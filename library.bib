abstract = {Since its first release in 2007, GeneCodis has become a valuable tool to functionally interpret results from experimental techniques in genomics. This web-based application integrates different sources of information to finding groups of genes with similar biological meaning. This process, known as enrichment analysis, is essential in the interpretation of high-throughput experiments. The frequent feedbacks and the natural evolution of genomics and bioinformatics have allowed the growth of the tool and the development of this third release. In this version, a special effort has been made to remove noisy and redundant output from the enrichment results with the inclusion of a recently reported algorithm that summarizes significantly enriched terms and generates functionally coherent modules of genes and terms. A new comparative analysis has been added to allow the differential analysis of gene sets. To expand the scope of the application, new sources of biological information have been included, such as genetic diseases, drugs-genes interactions and Pubmed information among others. Finally, the graphic section has been renewed with the inclusion of new interactive graphics and filtering options. The application is freely available at http://genecodis.cnb.csic.es.},

abstract = {\textit{Candida albicans} is a common fungal pathogen of humans that colonizes the skin and mucosal surfaces of most healthy individuals. Until recently, little was known about the mechanisms by which mucosal antifungal defences tolerate colonizing C. albicans but react strongly when hyphae of the same microorganism attempt to invade tissue. In this Review, we describe the properties of yeast cells and hyphae that are relevant to their interaction with the host, and the immunological mechanisms that differentially recognize colonizing versus invading C. albicans.},

abstract = {Better prognostic predictors for invasive candidiasis (IC) are needed to tailor and individualize therapeutic decision-making and minimize its high morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether molecular profiling of IgG-antibody response to the whole soluble Candida proteome could reveal a prognostic signature that may serve to devise a clinical-outcome prediction model for IC and contribute to known IC prognostic factors. By serological proteome analysis and data-mining procedures, serum 31-IgG antibody-reactivity patterns were examined in 45 IC patients randomly split into training and test sets. Within the training cohort, unsupervised two-way hierarchical clustering and principal-component analyses segregated IC patients into two antibody-reactivity subgroups with distinct prognoses that were unbiased by traditional IC prognostic factors and other patients-related variables. Supervised discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation identified a five-IgG antibody-reactivity signature as the most simplified and accurate IC clinical-outcome predictor, from which an IC prognosis score (ICPS) was derived. Its robustness was confirmed in the test set. Multivariate logistic-regression and receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses demonstrated that the ICPS was able to accurately discriminate IC patients at high risk for death from those at low risk and outperformed conventional IC prognostic factors. Further validation of the five-IgG antibody-reactivity signature on a multiplexed immunoassay supported the serological proteome analysis results. The five IgG antibodies incorporated in the ICPS made biologic sense and were associated either with good-prognosis and protective patterns (those to Met6p, Hsp90p, and Pgk1p, putative Candida virulence factors and antiapoptotic mediators) or with poor-prognosis and risk patterns (those to Ssb1p and Gap1p/Tdh3p, potential Candida proapoptotic mediators). We conclude that the ICPS, with additional refinement in future larger prospective cohorts, could be applicable to reliably predict patient clinical-outcome for individualized therapy of IC. Our data further provide insights into molecular mechanisms that may influence clinical outcome in IC and uncover potential targets for vaccine design and immunotherapy against IC.},

abstract = {Themore tests we performon a set of data, themore likely we are to reject the null hypothesis when it is true (i.e., a Type I error). This is a consequence of the logic of hypothesis testing: We reject the null hypothesis if we witness a rare event. But the larger the number of tests, the easier it is to find rare events and therefore the easier it is tomake themistake of thinking that there is an ef- fectwhen there is none. This problemis called the inflation of the alpha level. In order to be protected fromit, one strategy is to cor- rect the alpha level when performing multiple tests. Making the alpha levelmore stringent (i.e., smaller) will create less errors, but itmay alsomake it harder to detect real effects.},

abstract = {Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is an accurate quantitative technique, typically used for small-molecule mass spectrometry (MS). SRM has emerged as an important technique for targeted and hypothesis-driven proteomic research, and is becoming the reference method for protein quantification in complex biological samples. SRM offers high selectivity, a lower limit of detection and improved reproducibility, compared to conventional shot-gun-based tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) methods. Unlike LC-MS/MS, which requires computationally intensive informatic postanalysis, SRM requires preacquisition bioinformatic analysis to determine proteotypic peptides and optimal transitions to uniquely identify and to accurately quantitate proteins of interest. Extensive arrays of bioinformatics software tools, both web-based and stand-alone, have been published to assist researchers to determine optimal peptides and transition sets. The transitions are oftentimes selected based on preferred precursor charge state, peptide molecular weight, hydrophobicity, fragmentation pattern at a given collision energy (CE), and instrumentation chosen. Validation of the selected transitions for each peptide is critical since peptide performance varies depending on the mass spectrometer used. In this review, we provide an overview of open source and commercial bioinformatic tools for analyzing LC-MS data acquired by SRM.},

abstract = {The ability to switch from yeast to hyphal growth is essential for virulence in \textit{Candida albicans}. The cell surface is the initial point of contact between the fungus and the host. In this work, a free-gel proteomic strategy based on tryptic digestion of live yeast and hyphae cells and protein identification using LC-MS/MS methodology was used to identify cell surface proteins. Using this strategy, a total of 943 proteins were identified, of which 438 were in yeast and 928 were in hyphae. Of these proteins, 79 were closely related to the organization and biogenesis of the cell wall, including 28 GPI-anchored proteins, such as Hyr1 and Sod5 which were detected exclusively in hyphae, and Als2 and Sap10which were detected only in yeast. A group of 17proteins of unknown function were subsequently studied by analysis of the corresponding deletion mutants. We found that four new proteins, Pst3, Tos1, Orf19.3060 and Orf19.5352are involved in cell wall integrity and in C. albicans engulfment by macrophages. Moreover, the putative NADH-ubiquinone-related proteins, Ali1, Mci4, Orf19.287 and Orf19.7590, are also involved in osmotic and oxidative resistance, yeast to hypha transition and the ability to damage and invade oral epithelial cells. Biological significance This work describes the identification of surface proteins of C. albicans when grown in the yeast and hypha forms using a cell shaving treatment followed by peptide separation and protein identification using LC-MS/MS methodology. Significant protein differences were observed between the morphologies. The number of detected proteins is the most extensive and complex published up to now using this strategy. This methodology has allowed detecting new proteins related to relevant functions in the host such as cell wall integrity, stress resistance and host-pathogen interaction, verified by phenotypic and virulence assays in vitro and in vivo using 17 mutant strains.},

To an extent greater than has previously been possible with the more familiar "soft" ionization methods, this technique makes the power and elegance of mass spectrometric analysis applicable to the large and fragile polar molecules that play such vital roles in biological systems. The distinguishing features of electrospray spectra for large molecules are coherent sequences of peaks whose component ions are multiply charged, the ions of each peak differing by one charge from those of adjacent neighbors in the sequence. Spectra have been obtained for biopolymers including oligonucleotides and proteins, the latter having molecular weights up to 130,000, with as yet no evidence of an upper limit.},

abstract = {The shotgun proteomic strategy based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry and automated database searching has become the method of choice for identifying proteins in most large scale studies. However, the peptide-centric nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins. In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent informatic approaches. We also discuss related issues such as the state of protein sequence databases and their role in shotgun proteomic analysis, interpretation of relative peptide quantification data in the presence of multiple protein isoforms, the integration of proteomic and transcriptional data, and the development of a computational infrastructure for the integration of multiple diverse datasets.},

abstract = {With the rapid advance of MS-based proteomics one might think that 2D gel-based proteomics is dead. This is far from the truth. Current research has shown that there are still a number of places in the field of protein and molecular biology where 2D gels still play a leading role. The aim of this review is to highlight some of these applications. Examples from our own research as well as from other published works are used to illustrate the 2D gel driven research in the areas of: 1) de novo sequencing and protein identification from organisms with no or incomplete genome sequences available; 2) alternative detection methods for modification specific proteomics; 3) identification of protein isoforms and modified proteins. With an example of the glycoprotein TIMP-1 protein we illustrate the unique properties of 2D gels for the separation and characterisation of multiply modified proteins. We also show that careful analysis of experimental and theoretical protein mass and pI can lead to the identification of unanticipated protein variants modified by for example proteolytic cleavage. Together this shows that there is an important niche for 2D gel-based proteomics, which compliments traditional LC-MS techniques for specific protein research purposes.},

abstract = {Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a targeted mass spectrometry technique that provides sensitive and accurate protein detection and quantification in complex biological mixtures. Statistical and computational tools are essential for the design and analysis of SRM experiments, particularly in studies with large sample throughput. Currently, most such tools focus on the selection of optimized transitions and on processing signals from SRM assays. Little attention is devoted to protein significance analysis, which combines the quantitative measurements for a protein across isotopic labels, peptides, charge states, transitions, samples, and conditions, and detects proteins that change in abundance between conditions while controlling the false discovery rate. We propose a statistical modeling framework for protein significance analysis. It is based on linear mixed-effects models and is applicable to most experimental designs for both isotope label-based and label-free SRM workflows. We illustrate the utility of the framework in two studies: one with a group comparison experimental design and the other with a time course experimental design. We further verify the accuracy of the framework in two controlled data sets, one from the NCI-CPTAC reproducibility investigation and the other from an in-house spike-in study. The proposed framework is sensitive and specific, produces accurate results in broad experimental circumstances, and helps to optimally design future SRM experiments. The statistical framework is implemented in an open-source R-based software package SRMstats, and can be used by researchers with a limited statistics background as a stand-alone tool or in integration with the existing computational pipelines.},

abstract = {The interaction of \textit{Candida albicans} with macrophages is considered a crucial step in the development of an adequate immune response in systemic candidiasis. An in vitro model of phagocytosis that includes a differential staining procedure to discriminate between internalized and non-internalized yeast was developed. Upon optimization of a protocol to obtain an enriched population of ingested yeasts, a thorough genomics and proteomics analysis was carried out on these cells. Both proteins and mRNA were obtained from the same sample and analyzed in parallel. The combination of two-dimensional PAGE with MS revealed a total of 132 differentially expressed yeast protein species upon macrophage interaction. Among these species, 67 unique proteins were identified. This is the first time that a proteomics approach has been used to study C. albicans-macrophage interaction. We provide evidence of a rapid protein response of the fungus to adapt to the new environment inside the phagosome by changing the expression of proteins belonging to different pathways. The clear down-regulation of the carbon-compound metabolism, plus the up-regulation of lipid, fatty acid, glyoxylate, and tricarboxylic acid cycles, indicates that yeast shifts to a starvation mode. There is an important activation of the degradation and detoxification protein machinery. The complementary genomics approach led to the detection of specific pathways related to the virulence of Candida. Network analyses allowed us to generate a hypothetical model of Candida cell death after macrophage interaction, highlighting the interconnection between actin cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and autophagy in the regulation of apoptosis. In conclusion, the combination of genomics, proteomics, and network analyses is a powerful strategy to better understand the complex host-pathogen interactions.},

abstract = {In proteomics, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is rapidly gaining importance for targeted protein quantification. The triple quadrupole mass analyzers used in SRM assays allow for levels of specificity and sensitivity hard to accomplish by more standard shotgun proteomics experiments. Often, an SRM assay is built by in silico prediction of transitions and/or extraction of peptide precursor and fragment ions from a spectral library. Spectral libraries are typically generated from nonideal ion trap based shotgun proteomics experiments or synthetic peptide libraries, consuming considerable time and effort. Here, we investigate the usability of beam type CID (or "higher energy CID" (HCD)) peptide fragmentation spectra, as acquired using an Orbitrap Velos, to facilitate SRM assay development. Therefore, peptide fragmentation spectra, obtained by ion-trap CID, triple-quadrupole CID (QqQ-CID) and Orbitrap HCD, originating from digested cellular lysates, were compared. Spectral comparison and a dedicated correlation algorithm indicated significantly higher similarity between QqQ-CID and HCD fragmentation spectra than between QqQ-CID and ion trap-CID spectra. SRM transitions generated using a constructed HCD spectral library increased SRM assay sensitivity up to 2-fold, when compared to the use of a library created from more conventionally used ion trap-CID spectra, showing that HCD spectra can assist SRM assay development.},

@article{Saville2003,
abstract = {It is widely assumed that the ability of \textit{Candida albicans} to switch between different morphologies is required for pathogenesis. However, most virulence studies have used mutants that are permanently locked into either the yeast or filamentous forms which are avirulent but unsuitable for discerning the role of morphogenetic conversions at the various stages of the infectious process. We have constructed a strain in which this developmental transition can be externally modulated both in vitro and in vivo. This was achieved by placing one copy of the NRG1 gene (a negative regulator of filamentation) under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter. This modified strain was then tested in an animal model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. Mice injected with this strain under conditions permitting hyphal development succumbed to the infection, whereas all of the animals injected under conditions that inhibited this transition survived. Importantly, fungal burdens were almost identical in both sets of animals, indicating that, whereas filament formation appears to be required for the mortality resulting from a deep-seated infection, yeast cells play an important role early in the infectious process by extravasating and disseminating to the target organs. Moreover, these infecting Candida yeast cells still retained their pathogenic potential, as demonstrated by allowing this developmental transition to occur at various time points postinfection. We demonstrate here the importance of morphogenetic conversions in C. albicans pathogenesis. This engineered strain should provide a useful tool in unraveling the individual contributions of the yeast and filamentous forms at various stages of the infectious process.},

Different mass spectrometers output their raw spectral data in a variety of proprietary formats, and alternative methods that assign peptides to MS/MS spectra and infer protein identifications from those peptide assignments each write their results in different formats. Here we describe an MS/MS analysis platform, the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, which makes use of open XML file formats for storage of data at the raw spectral data, peptide, and protein levels. This platform enables uniform analysis and exchange of MS/MS data generated from a variety of different instruments, and assigned peptides using a variety of different database search programs. We demonstrate this by applying the pipeline to data sets generated by ThermoFinnigan LCQ, ABI 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF, and Waters Q-TOF instruments, and searched in turn using SEQUEST, Mascot, and COMET.},

@article{Prieto2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein inference from peptide identifications in shotgun proteomics must deal with ambiguities that arise due to the presence of peptides shared between different proteins, which is common in higher eukaryotes. Recently data independent acquisition (DIA) approaches have emerged as an alternative to the traditional data dependent acquisition (DDA) in shotgun proteomics experiments. MSE is the term used to name one of the DIA approaches used in QTOF instruments. MSE data require specialized software to process acquired spectra and to perform peptide and protein identifications. However the software available at the moment does not group the identified proteins in a transparent way by taking into account peptide evidence categories. Furthermore the inspection, comparison and report of the obtained results require tedious manual intervention. Here we report a software tool to address these limitations for MSE data.

RESULTS: In this paper we present PAnalyzer, a software tool focused on the protein inference process of shotgun proteomics. Our approach considers all the identified proteins and groups them when necessary indicating their confidence using different evidence categories. PAnalyzer can read protein identification files in the XML output format of the ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) software provided by Waters Corporation for their MSE data, and also in the mzIdentML format recently standardized by HUPO-PSI. Multiple files can also be read simultaneously and are considered as technical replicates. Results are saved to CSV, HTML and mzIdentML (in the case of a single mzIdentML input file) files. An MSE analysis of a real sample is presented to compare the results of PAnalyzer and ProteinLynx Global Server.

CONCLUSIONS: We present a software tool to deal with the ambiguities that arise in the protein inference process. Key contributions are support for MSE data analysis by ProteinLynx Global Server and technical replicates integration. PAnalyzer is an easy to use multiplatform and free software tool.},

CandidaDB Release 2.0 (June 2004) contains information pertaining to Assembly 19 of the genome of C.albicans strain SC5314. The current release contains 6244 annotated entries corresponding to 130 tRNA genes and 5917 protein-coding genes.

CandidaDB is based on GenoList, a generic relational data schema and a World Wide Web interface that has been adapted to the handling of eukaryotic genomes. The interface allows users to browse easily through genome data and retrieve information. CandidaDB also provides more elaborate tools, such as pattern searching, that are tightly connected to the overall browsing system. As the C.albicans genome is diploid and still incompletely assembled, CandidaDB provides tools to browse the genome by individual supercontigs and to examine information about allelic sequences obtained from complementary contigs.

abstract = {Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a technique for quantifying specific proteins using triple quadrupole MS. Proteins are digested into peptides and fed into MS following HPLC separation. The stream of ionized peptides is filtered by m/z ratio so only specific peptide targets enter the collision cell, where they are fragmented into product ions. A specific product ion is then filtered from the cell and its intensity measured. By spiking an isotopically labeled version of each target peptide into a sample, both native and surrogate peptides enter MS, pass the filters and transition into product ions in tandem; thus the quantity of the native peptide may be calculated by examining the relative intensities of the native and surrogate signals. The choice of precursor-to-product ion transitions is critical for SRM, but predicting the best candidates is challenging and time-consuming. To alleviate this problem, software tools for designing and optimizing transitions have recently emerged, predominantly driven by data from public proteomics repositories, such as the Global Proteome Machine and PeptideAtlas. In this review, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in automated SRM transition design tools in the public domain, explaining how the systems work and how to use them.},

The principle of this method can be applied to develop other kinase assays and thus should contribute to the understanding of processes controlled by protein kinases.

abstract = {A technique has been developed for the separation of proteins by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Due to its resolution and sensitivity, this technique is a powerful tool for the analysis and detection of proteins from complex biological sources. Proteins are separated according to isoelectric point by isoelectric focusing in the first dimension, and according to molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the second dimension. Since these two parameters are unrelated, it is possible to obtain an almost uniform distribution of protein spots across a two-diminsional gel. This technique has resolved 1100 different components from Escherichia coli and should be capable of resolving a maximum of 5000 proteins. A protein containing as little as one disintegration per min of either 14C or 35S can be detected by autoradiography. A protein which constitutes 10 minus 4 to 10 minus 5{\%} of the total protein can be detected and quantified by autoradiography. The reproducibility of the separation is sufficient to permit each spot on one separation to be matched with a spot on a different separation. This technique provides a method for estimation (at the described sensitivities) of the number of proteins made by any biological system. This system can resolve proteins differing in a single charge and consequently can be used in the analysis of in vivo modifications resulting in a change in charge. Proteins whose charge is changed by missense mutations can be identified. A detailed description of the methods as well as the characteristics of this system are presented.},

The potential distribution of the field can be represented as a combination of quadrupole and logarithmic potentials. In the absence of any magnetic or rf fields, ion stability is achieved only due to ions orbiting around an axial electrode. Orbiting ions also perform harmonic oscillations along the electrode with frequency proportional to (m/z)-1/2. These oscillations are detected using image current detection and are transformed into mass spectra using fast FT, similarly to FTICR. Practical aspects of the trap design are presented. High-mass resolution up to 150,000 for ions produced by laser ablation has been demonstrated, along with high-energy acceptance and wide mass range.},

In this study, we evaluate the effect of this "two-peptide" rule on protein identifications, using multiple search tools and data sets. Contrary to the intuition, the "two-peptide" rule reduces the number of protein identifications in the target database more significantly than in the decoy database and results in increased false discovery rates, compared to the case when single-hit proteins are not discarded. We therefore recommend that the "two-peptide" rule should be abandoned, and instead, protein identifications should be subject to the estimation of error rates, as is the case with peptide identifications. We further extend the generating function approach (originally proposed for evaluating matches between a peptide and a single spectrum) to evaluating matches between a protein and an entire spectral data set.},

Although most infections occur in patients who are immunocompromised or debilitated in some other way, the organism most often responsible for disease, \textit{Candida albicans}, expresses several virulence factors that contribute to pathogenesis. These factors include host recognition biomolecules (adhesins), morphogenesis (the reversible transition between unicellular yeast cells and filamentous, growth forms), secreted aspartyl proteases and phospholipases. Additionally, ‘phenotypic switching’ is accompanied by changes in antigen expression, colony morphology and tissue affinities in C. albicans and several other Candida spp. Switching might provide cells with a flexibility that results in the adaptation of the organism to the hostile conditions imposed not only by the host but also by the physician treating the infection.},

The approach is based on the assumption that each protein present in a sample reproducibly and predictably generates a relatively small number of peptides that can be identified by mass spectrometry. In this study this assumption was examined by a targeted peptide sequencing strategy using inclusion lists to trigger peptide fragmentation attempts. It was found that the number of peptides observed from a single protein is at least one order of magnitude greater than previously assumed. This unexpected complexity of proteomics samples implies substantial technical challenges, explains some perplexing results in the proteomics literature, and prompts the need for developing alternative experimental strategies for the rapid and comprehensive analysis of proteomes.},

abstract = {The outer layer of the \textit{Candida albicans} cell wall is enriched in highly glycosylated proteins. The major class, the GlycosylPhosphatidylInositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are tethered to the wall by GPI-anchor remnants and include adhesins, glycosyltransferases, yapsins and superoxide dismutases. In silico analysis suggested that C. albicans possesses 115 putative GPI anchored proteins (GpiPs), almost twice the number reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A global approach to characterise in silico predicted GpiPs has been initiated by generating a library of 45 mutants. This library was subjected to a screen for cell wall modifications by testing the cell wall integrity (SDS and Calcofluor White sensitivity) and response to caspofungin. We showed that, when caspofungin sensitivity was modified, in more than half of the cases the susceptibility can be correlated to the level of chitin and cell wall thickness: sensitive strains have low level of chitin and a thin cell wall. We also identified, for the first time, genes that when deleted lead to decreased caspofungin sensitivity: DFG5, PHR1, PGA4 and PGA62. The role of two unknown GpiPs, Pga31 and Pga62 in the cell wall structure and composition was clearly demonstrated during this study.},

The existence of fungal QS systems was revealed ten years ago after the discovery that farnesol controls filamentation in the pathogenic polymorphic fungus \textit{Candida albicans}. In the past decade, farnesol has been shown to play multiple roles in C. albicans physiology as a signaling molecule and inducing detrimental effects on host cells and other microbes. In addition to farnesol, the aromatic alcohol tyrosol was also found to be a C. albicans QS molecule (QSM) controlling growth, morphogenesis and biofilm formation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two other aromatic alcohols, phenylethanol and tryptophol were found to be QSMs regulating morphogenesis during nitrogen starvation conditions. Additionally, population density-dependent behaviors that resemble QS have been described in several other fungal species. Although fungal QS research is still in its infancy, its discovery has changed our views about the fungal kingdom and could eventually lead to the development of new antifungal therapeutics.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach to the identification of mass spectrometrically fragmented peptides. A fragmentation spectrum usually contains a short, easily identifiable series of sequence ions, which yields a partial sequence. This partial sequence divides the peptide into three parts-regions 1, 2, and 3-characterized by the added mass m1 of region 1, the partial sequence of region 2, and the added mass m3 of region 3. We call the construct, m1 partial sequence m3, a "peptide sequence tag" and show that it is a highly specific identifier of the peptide. An algorithm developed here that uses the sequence tag to find the peptide in a sequence database is up to 1 million-fold more discriminating than the partial sequence information alone. Peptides can be identified even in the presence of an unknown posttranslational modification or an amino acid substitution between an entry in the sequence database and the measured peptide. These concepts are demonstrated with model and practical examples of electrospray mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides. Just two to three amino acid residues derived by fragmentation are enough to identify these peptides. In peptide mapping applications, even less information is necessary.},

abstract = {The development of the HUPO-PSI's (Proteomics Standards Initiative) standard data formats and MIAPE (Minimum Information About a Proteomics Experiment) guidelines should improve proteomics data sharing within the scientific community. Proteomics journals have encouraged the use of these standards and guidelines to improve the quality of experimental reporting and ease the evaluation and publication of manuscripts. However, there is an evident lack of bioinformatics tools specifically designed to create and edit standard file formats and reports, or embed them within proteomics workflows. In this article, we describe a new web-based software suite (The ProteoRed MIAPE web toolkit) that performs several complementary roles related to proteomic data standards. First, it can verify that the reports fulfill the minimum information requirements of the corresponding MIAPE modules, highlighting inconsistencies or missing information. Second, the toolkit can convert several XML-based data standards directly into human readable MIAPE reports stored within the ProteoRed MIAPE repository. Finally, it can also perform the reverse operation, allowing users to export from MIAPE reports into XML files for computational processing, data sharing, or public database submission.

abstract = {SUMMARY: Tandem mass spectra obtained from fragmenting peptide ions contain some peptide sequence specific information, but often there is not enough information to sequence the original peptide completely. Several proprietary software applications have been developed to attempt to match the spectra with a list of protein sequences that may contain the sequence of the peptide. The application TANDEM was written to provide the proteomics research community with a set of components that can be used to test new methods and algorithms for performing this type of sequence-to-data matching.

abstract = {Development of robust statistical methods for validation of peptide assignments to tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra obtained using database searching remains an important problem. PeptideProphet is one of the commonly used computational tools available for that purpose. An alternative simple approach for validation of peptide assignments is based on addition of decoy (reversed, randomized, or shuffled) sequences to the searched protein sequence database. The probabilistic modeling approach of PeptideProphet and the decoy strategy can be combined within a single semisupervised framework, leading to improved robustness and higher accuracy of computed probabilities even in the case of most challenging data sets. We present a semisupervised expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for constructing a Bayes classifier for peptide identification using the probability mixture model, extending PeptideProphet to incorporate decoy peptide matches. Using several data sets of varying complexity, from control protein mixtures to a human plasma sample, and using three commonly used database search programs, SEQUEST, MASCOT, and TANDEM/k-score, we illustrate that more accurate mixture estimation leads to an improved control of the false discovery rate in the classification of peptide assignments.},

The human host has also co-evolved to recognize and eliminate potential fungal invaders. Many of the fungal genes that have been the focus of this co-evolutionary process encode cell wall components. In this review, we will discuss the transition from commensalism to pathogenesis, the key players of the fungal cell surface that are important for this transition, the role of the morphology and the mechanisms of host recognition and response.},

abstract = {\textit{Candida albicans} ECM33 encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell wall protein that is important for cell wall integrity. It is also critical for normal virulence in the mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. To identify potential mechanisms through which Ecm33p contributes to virulence, we investigated the interactions of C. albicans ecm33Delta mutants with endothelial cells and the FaDu oral epithelial cell line in vitro. The growth rate of blastospores of strains containing either one or no intact copies of ECM33 was 50{\%} slower than that of strains containing two intact copies of ECM33. However, all strains germinated at the same rate, forming similar-length hyphae on endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells. Strains containing either one or no intact copies of ECM33 had modestly reduced adherence to both types of host cells, and a markedly reduced capacity to invade and damage these cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing C. albicans ECM33 did not adhere to or invade epithelial cells, suggesting that Ecm33p by itself does not act as an adhesin or invasin. Examination of ecm33Delta mutants by transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cell wall of these strains had an abnormally electron-dense outer mannoprotein layer, which may represent a compensatory response to reduced cell wall integrity. The hyphae of these mutants also had aberrant surface localization of the adhesin Als1p. Collectively, these results suggest that Ecm33p is required for normal cell wall architecture as well as normal function and expression of cell surface proteins in C. albicans.},

abstract = {A notable inefficiency of shotgun proteomics experiments is the repeated rediscovery of the same identifiable peptides by sequence database searching methods, which often are time-consuming and error-prone. A more precise and efficient method, in which previously observed and identified peptide MS/MS spectra are catalogued and condensed into searchable spectral libraries to allow new identifications by spectral matching, is seen as a promising alternative. To that end, an open-source, functionally complete, high-throughput and readily extensible MS/MS spectral searching tool, SpectraST, was developed. A high-quality spectral library was constructed by combining the high-confidence identifications of millions of spectra taken from various data repositories and searched using four sequence search engines. The resulting library consists of over 30,000 spectra for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using this library, SpectraST vastly outperforms the sequence search engine SEQUEST in terms of speed and the ability to discriminate good and bad hits. A unique advantage of SpectraST is its full integration into the popular Trans Proteomic Pipeline suite of software, which facilitates user adoption and provides important functionalities such as peptide and protein probability assignment, quantification, and data visualization. This method of spectral library searching is especially suited for targeted proteomics applications, offering superior performance to traditional sequence searching.},

Our report contains the first proteomic analysis of EVs in C. albicans and a comparative proteomic study of the soluble secreted proteins. With this purpose, cell-free culture supernatants from C. albicans were separated into EVs and EV-free supernatant and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A total of 96 proteins were identified including 75 and 61 proteins in EVs and EV-free supernatant, respectively. Out of these, 40 proteins were found in secretome by proteomic analysis for the first time. The soluble proteins were enriched in cell wall and secreted pathogenesis related proteins. Interestingly, more than 90{\%} of these EV-free supernatant proteins were classical secretory proteins with predicted N-terminal signal peptide, whereas all the leaderless proteins involved in metabolism, including some moonlighting proteins, or in the exocytosis and endocytosis process were exclusively cargo of the EVs. We propose a model of the different mechanisms used by C. albicans secreted proteins to reach the extracellular medium. Furthermore, we tested the potential of the Bgl2 protein, identified in vesicles and EV-free supernatant, to protect against a systemic candidiasis in a murine model.},

Here we present a strategy for the absolute quantification (termed AQUA) of proteins and their modification states. Peptides are synthesized with incorporated stable isotopes as ideal internal standards to mimic native peptides formed by proteolysis. These synthetic peptides can also be prepared with covalent modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, etc.) that are chemically identical to naturally occurring posttranslational modifications. Such AQUA internal standard peptides are then used to precisely and quantitatively measure the absolute levels of proteins and posttranslationally modified proteins after proteolysis by using a selected reaction monitoring analysis in a tandem mass spectrometer. In the present work, the AQUA strategy was used to (i) quantify low abundance yeast proteins involved in gene silencing, (ii) quantitatively determine the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-1126 of human separase protein, and (iii) identify kinases capable of phosphorylating Ser-1501 of separase in an in vitro kinase assay.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry based quantification of peptides can be performed using the iTRAQ reagent in conjunction with mass spectrometry. This technology yields information about the relative abundance of single peptides. A method for the calculation of reliable quantification information is required in order to obtain biologically relevant data at the protein expression level.

RESULTS: A method comprising sound error estimation and statistical methods is presented that allows precise abundance analysis plus error calculation at the peptide as well as at the protein level. This yields the relevant information that is required for quantitative proteomics. Comparing the performance of our method named Quant with existing approaches the error estimation is reliable and offers information for precise bioinformatic models. Quant is shown to generate results that are consistent with those produced by ProQuant, thus validating both systems. Moreover, the results are consistent with that of Mascot 2.2. The MATLAB scripts of Quant are freely available via http://www.protein-ms.de and http://sourceforge.net/projects/protms/, each under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

CONCLUSION: The software Quant demonstrates improvements in protein quantification using iTRAQ. Precise quantification data can be obtained at the protein level when using error propagation and adequate visualization. Quant integrates both and additionally provides the possibility to obtain more reliable results by calculation of wise quality measures. Peak area integration has been replaced by sum of intensities, yielding more reliable quantification results. Additionally, Quant allows the combination of quantitative information obtained by iTRAQ with peptide and protein identifications from popular tandem MS identification tools. Hence Quant is a useful tool for the proteomics community and may help improving analysis of proteomic experimental data. In addition, we have shown that a lognormal distribution fits the data of mass spectrometry based relative peptide quantification.},

The two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis database delivers experimental data on microbial proteins including mass spectra for the validation of protein identification. The ICAT-LC/MS database comprises experimental data for protein alterations of mycobacterial strains BCG vs. H37Rv. By formulating complex queries within a functional protein classification database "FUNC{\_}CLASS" for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori the researcher can gather precise information on genes, proteins, protein classes and metabolic pathways. The use of the R language in the database architecture allows high-level data analysis and visualization to be performed "on-the-fly". The database system is centrally administrated, and investigators without specific bioinformatic competence in database construction can submit their data. The database system also serves as a template for a prototype of a European Proteome Database of Pathogenic Bacteria. Currently, the database system includes proteome information for six strains of microorganisms.},

abstract = {Yeast has been a valuable model to study replicative and chronological ageing processes. Replicative ageing is defined by the number of daughter cells a mother can give birth to and hence reflects the ageing situation in proliferating cells, whereas chronological ageing is widely accepted as a model for postmitotic tissue ageing. Since both ageing forms end in yeast programmed death (necrotic and apoptotic), and abrogation of cell death by deletion of the apoptotic machinery or diminishment of oxidative radicals leads to longevity, apoptosis and ageing seem closely connected. This review focuses on ageing as a physiological way to induce yeast apoptosis, which unexpectedly defines apoptosis as a pro- and not an anti-ageing mechanism.},

abstract = {Malaria infections of mammals are initiated by the transmission of Plasmodium salivary gland sporozoites during an Anopheles mosquito vector bite. Sporozoites make their way through the skin and eventually to the liver, where they infect hepatocytes. Blocking this initial stage of infection is a promising malaria vaccine strategy. Therefore, comprehensively elucidating the protein composition of sporozoites will be invaluable in identifying novel targets for blocking infection. Previous efforts to identify the proteins expressed in Plasmodium mosquito stages were hampered by the technical difficulty of separating the parasite from its vector; without effective purifications, the large majority of proteins identified were of vector origin. Here we describe the proteomic profiling of highly purified salivary gland sporozoites from two Plasmodium species: human-infective Plasmodium falciparum and rodent-infective Plasmodium yoelii. The combination of improved sample purification and high mass accuracy mass spectrometry has facilitated the most complete proteome coverage to date for a pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite. A total of 1991 P. falciparum sporozoite proteins and 1876 P. yoelii sporozoite proteins were identified, with >86{\%} identified with high sequence coverage. The proteomic data were used to confirm the presence of components of three features critical for sporozoite infection of the mammalian host: the sporozoite motility and invasion apparatus (glideosome), sporozoite signaling pathways, and the contents of the apical secretory organelles. Furthermore, chemical labeling and identification of proteins on live sporozoites revealed previously uncharacterized complexity of the putative sporozoite surface-exposed proteome. Taken together, the data constitute the most comprehensive analysis to date of the protein expression of salivary gland sporozoites and reveal novel potential surface-exposed proteins that might be valuable targets for antibody blockage of infection.},

C-HPP also prioritizes particular protein subsets, such as those with post-translational modifications (PTMs) and those found in low abundance. As participants in C-HPP, we integrated proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis results from chromosome-independent biomarker discovery research to create a chromosome-based list of proteins and phosphorylation sites. Data were integrated from five independent colorectal cancer (CRC) samples (three types of clinical tissue and two types of cell lines) and lead to the identification of 11,278 proteins, including 8,305 phosphoproteins and 28,205 phosphorylation sites; all of these were categorized on a chromosome-by-chromosome basis. In total, 3,033 "missing proteins", i.e., proteins that currently lack evidence by mass spectrometry, in the neXtProt database and 12,852 unknown phosphorylation sites not registered in the PhosphoSitePlus database were identified. Our in-depth phosphoproteomic study represents a significant contribution to C-HPP.

abstract = {Most proteomic studies use liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the peptides generated by the proteolysis of a biological sample. However, with the current methods it remains challenging to rapidly, consistently, reproducibly, accurately, and sensitively detect and quantify large fractions of proteomes across multiple samples. Here we present a new strategy that systematically queries sample sets for the presence and quantity of essentially any protein of interest. It consists of using the information available in fragment ion spectral libraries to mine the complete fragment ion maps generated using a data-independent acquisition method. For this study, the data were acquired on a fast, high resolution quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) instrument by repeatedly cycling through 32 consecutive 25-Da precursor isolation windows (swaths). This SWATH MS acquisition setup generates, in a single sample injection, time-resolved fragment ion spectra for all the analytes detectable within the 400-1200 m/z precursor range and the user-defined retention time window. We show that suitable combinations of fragment ions extracted from these data sets are sufficiently specific to confidently identify query peptides over a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude, even if the precursors of the queried peptides are not detectable in the survey scans. We also show that queried peptides are quantified with a consistency and accuracy comparable with that of selected reaction monitoring, the gold standard proteomic quantification method. Moreover, targeted data extraction enables ad libitum quantification refinement and dynamic extension of protein probing by iterative re-mining of the once-and-forever acquired data sets. This combination of unbiased, broad range precursor ion fragmentation and targeted data extraction alleviates most constraints of present proteomic methods and should be equally applicable to the comprehensive analysis of other classes of analytes, beyond proteomics.},

abstract = {\textit{Candida albicans} is a commensal inhabitant of the normal human microflora that can become pathogenic and invade almost all body sites and organs in response to both host-mediated and fungus-mediated mechanisms. Serologic responses to C. albicans that underlie its dichotomist relationship with the host (host-commensal and host-pathogen interactions) display a high degree of heterogeneity, resulting in distinct serum anti-Candida antibody signatures (molecular fingerprints of anti-Candida antibodies in serum) that can be used to discriminate commensal colonization from invasive disease. We describe the typical proteomic strategy to globally and integratively profile these host antibody responses and determine serum antibody signatures. This approach is based on the combination of classic immunoproteomics or serologic proteome analysis (two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by quantitative Western blotting and mass spectrometry) with data mining procedures. This global proteomic stratagem is a useful tool not only for obtaining an overview of different anti-Candida antibodies that are being elicited during the host-fungus interaction and, consequently, of the complex C. albicans immunome (the subset of the C. albicans proteome targeted by the immune system), but also for evaluating how this pathogen organism interacts with its host to trigger infection. In contrast with genomics and transcriptomics, this proteomic technology has the potential to detect antigenicity associated with posttranslational modification, subcellular localization, and other functional aspects that can be relevant in the host immune response. Furthermore, this strategy to define molecular fingerprints of serum anti-Candida antibodies may hopefully bring to light potential candidates for diagnosis, prognosis, risk stratification, clinical follow-up, therapeutic monitoring, and/or immunotherapy of candidiasis, especially of its life-threatening systemic forms.},

abstract = {A rapid method for the identification of known proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is described in which molecular masses of peptide fragments are used to search a protein sequence database. The peptides are generated by in situ reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion of proteins electroblotted from two-dimensional gels. Masses are determined at the subpicomole level by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of the unfractionated digest. A computer program has been developed that searches the protein sequence database for multiple peptides of individual proteins that match the measured masses. To ensure that the most recent database updates are included, a theoretical digest of the entire database is generated each time the program is executed. This method facilitates simultaneous processing of a large number of two-dimensional gel spots. The method was applied to a two-dimensional gel of a crude Escherichia coli extract that was electroblotted onto poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. Ten randomly chosen spots were analyzed. With as few as three peptide masses, each protein was uniquely identified from over 91,000 protein sequences. All identifications were verified by concurrent N-terminal sequencing of identical spots from a second blot. One of the spots contained an N-terminally blocked protein that required enzymatic cleavage, peptide separation, and Edman degradation for confirmation of its identity.},

abstract = {The human fungal pathogen \textit{Candida albicans} switches from a budding yeast form to a polarized hyphal form in response to various external signals. This morphogenetic switching has been implicated in the development of pathogenicity. We have cloned the CaCDC35 gene encoding C. albicans adenylyl cyclase by functional complementation of the conditional growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with mutations in Ras1p and Ras2p. It has previously been shown that these Ras homologues regulate adenylyl cyclase in yeast. The C. albicans adenylyl cyclase is highly homologous to other fungal adenylyl cyclases but has less sequence similarity with the mammalian enzymes. C. albicans cells deleted for both alleles of CaCDC35 had no detectable cAMP levels, suggesting that this gene encodes the only adenylyl cyclase in C. albicans. The homozygous mutant cells were viable but grew more slowly than wild-type cells and were unable to switch from the yeast to the hyphal form under all environmental conditions that we analyzed in vitro. Moreover, this morphogenetic switch was completely blocked in mutant cells undergoing phagocytosis by macrophages. However, morphogenetic switching was restored by exogenous cAMP. On the basis of epistasis experiments, we propose that CaCdc35p acts downstream of the Ras homologue CaRas1p. These epistasis experiments also suggest that the putative transcription factor Efg1p and components of the hyphal-inducing MAP kinase pathway depend on the function of CaCdc35p in their ability to induce morphogenetic switching. Homozygous cacdc35 Delta cells were unable to establish vaginal infection in a mucosal membrane mouse model and were avirulent in a mouse model for systemic infections. These findings suggest that fungal adenylyl cyclases and other regulators of the cAMP signaling pathway may be useful targets for antifungal drugs.},

In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions of the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Searches of species-specific protein databases with tandem mass spectra acquired from peptides obtained from the enzymatically digested total proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells allowed matching of the spectra to amino acid sequences within proteins of these organisms.

To achieve saturation coverage of a proteome or specific subproteome via tandem mass spectrometric identification of tryptic protein sample digests, proteomics data sets are growing dramatically in size and heterogeneity. The trend toward very large integrated data sets poses so far unsolved challenges to control the uncertainty of protein identifications going beyond well established confidence measures for peptide-spectrum matches. We present MAYU, a novel strategy that reliably estimates false discovery rates for protein identifications in large scale data sets. We validated and applied MAYU using various large proteomics data sets. The data show that the size of the data set has an important and previously underestimated impact on the reliability of protein identifications. We particularly found that protein false discovery rates are significantly elevated compared with those of peptide-spectrum matches. The function provided by MAYU is critical to control the quality of proteome data repositories and thereby to enhance any study relying on these data sources. The MAYU software is available as standalone software and also integrated into the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline.},

abstract = {During the past years, yeast has been successfully established as a model to study mechanisms of apoptotic regulation. However, the beneficial effects of such a cell suicide program for a unicellular organism remained obscure. Here, we demonstrate that chronologically aged yeast cultures die exhibiting typical markers of apoptosis, accumulate oxygen radicals, and show caspase activation. Age-induced cell death is strongly delayed by overexpressing YAP1, a key transcriptional regulator in oxygen stress response. Disruption of apoptosis through deletion of yeast caspase YCA1 initially results in better survival of aged cultures. However, surviving cells lose the ability of regrowth, indicating that predamaged cells accumulate in the absence of apoptotic cell removal. Moreover, wild-type cells outlast yca1 disruptants in direct competition assays during long-term aging. We suggest that apoptosis in yeast confers a selective advantage for this unicellular organism, and demonstrate that old yeast cells release substances into the medium that stimulate survival of the clone.},

abstract = {A better understanding of the molecular basis of programmed cell death (PCD) in fungi could provide information that is useful in the design of antifungal drugs that combat life-threatening fungal infections. Harsh environmental stresses, such as acetic acid or hydrogen peroxide, have been shown to induce PCD in the pathogenic fungus \textit{Candida albicans}. In this study, we show that dying cells progress from an apoptotic state to a secondary necrotic state and that the rate at which this change occurs is proportional to the intensity of the stimulus. Also, we found that the temporal response is modulated by Ras-cAMP-PKA signals. Mutations that block Ras-cAMP-PKA signaling (ras1Delta, cdc35Delta, tpk1Delta, and tpk2Delta) suppress or delay the apoptotic response, whereas mutations that stimulate signaling (RAS1(val13) and pde2Delta) accelerate the rate of entry of cells into apoptosis. Pharmacological stimulation or inhibition of Ras signaling reinforces these findings. Transient increases in endogenous cAMP occur under conditions that stimulate apoptosis but not growth arrest. Death-specific changes in the abundance of different isoforms of the PKA regulatory subunit, Bcy1p, are also observed. Activation of Ras signals may regulate PCD of C. albicans, either by inhibiting antiapoptotic functions (such as stress responses) or by activating proapoptotic functions.},

The classes of antifungal agents most commonly used to treat Candida infections are the azoles, polyenes, and echinocandins. In the present study, we identified changes in C. albicans protein abundance using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy following exposure to representatives of the azole (ketoconazole), polyene (amphotericin B), and echinocandin (caspofungin) antifungals in an effort to elucidate the adaptive responses to these classes of antifungal agents. We identified 39 proteins whose abundance changed in response to ketoconazole exposure. Some of these proteins are involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and are associated with azole resistance. Exposure to amphotericin B altered the abundance of 43 proteins, including those associated with oxidative stress and osmotic tolerance. We identified 50 proteins whose abundance changed after exposure to caspofungin, including enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and integrity, as well as the regulator of beta-1,3-glucan synthase activity, Rho1p. Exposure to caspofungin also increased the abundance of the proteins involved in oxidative and osmotic stress. The common adaptive responses shared by all three antifungal agents included proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Some of these antifungal-responsive proteins may represent potential targets for the development of novel therapeutics that could enhance the antifungal activities of these drugs.},

Furthermore, several yeast orthologues of central metazoan apoptotic regulators have been identified, such as a caspase and a caspase-regulating serine protease. In addition, physiological occurrence of cell death has been detected during aging and mating in yeast. The finding of apoptosis in yeast, other fungi and parasites is not only of great medical relevance but will also help to understand some of the still unknown molecular mechanisms at the core of apoptotic execution.},

abstract = {High throughput identification of peptides in databases from tandem mass spectrometry data is a key technique in modern proteomics. Common approaches to interpret large scale peptide identification results are based on the statistical analysis of average score distributions, which are constructed from the set of best scores produced by large collections of MS/MS spectra by using searching engines such as SEQUEST. Other approaches calculate individual peptide identification probabilities on the basis of theoretical models or from single-spectrum score distributions constructed by the set of scores produced by each MS/MS spectrum. In this work, we study the mathematical properties of average SEQUEST score distributions by introducing the concept of spectrum quality and expressing these average distributions as compositions of single-spectrum distributions. We predict and demonstrate in the practice that average score distributions are dominated by the quality distribution in the spectra collection, except in the low probability region, where it is possible to predict the dependence of average probability on database size. Our analysis leads to a novel indicator, the probability ratio, which takes optimally into account the statistical information provided by the first and second best scores. The probability ratio is a non-parametric and robust indicator that makes spectra classification according to parameters such as charge state unnecessary and allows a peptide identification performance, on the basis of false discovery rates, that is better than that obtained by other empirical statistical approaches. The probability ratio also compares favorably with statistical probability indicators obtained by the construction of single-spectrum SEQUEST score distributions. These results make the robustness, conceptual simplicity, and ease of automation of the probability ratio algorithm a very attractive alternative to determine peptide identification confidences and error rates in high throughput experiments.},

All raw and processed data are made accessible in the S. pombe PeptideAtlas. The identified proteins showed no biases in functional properties and allowed global estimation of protein abundances. The high coverage of the PeptideAtlas allowed correlation with transcriptomic data in a system-wide manner indicating that post-transcriptional processes control the levels of at least half of all identified proteins. Interestingly, the correlation was not equally tight for all functional categories ranging from rs>0.80 for proteins involved in translation to rs<0.45 for signal transduction proteins. Moreover, many proteins involved in DNA damage repair could not be detected in the PeptideAtlas despite their high mRNA levels, strengthening the translation-on-demand hypothesis for members of this protein class. In summary, the extensive and public available S. pombe PeptideAtlas together with the generated proteotypic peptide spectral library will be a useful resource for future targeted, in-depth and quantitative proteomic studies on this microorganism.},

@article{Abbatiello2010a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) of peptides with stable isotope-labeled internal standards (SISs) is increasingly being used to develop quantitative assays for proteins in complex biological matrices. These assays can be highly precise and quantitative, but the frequent occurrence of interferences requires that MRM-MS data be manually reviewed, a time-intensive process subject to human error. We developed an algorithm that identifies inaccurate transition data based on the presence of interfering signal or inconsistent recovery among replicate samples.

METHODS: The algorithm objectively evaluates MRM-MS data with 2 orthogonal approaches. First, it compares the relative product ion intensities of the analyte peptide to those of the SIS peptide and uses a t-test to determine if they are significantly different. A CV is then calculated from the ratio of the analyte peak area to the SIS peak area from the sample replicates.

RESULTS: The algorithm identified problematic transitions and achieved accuracies of 94{\%}-100{\%}, with a sensitivity and specificity of 83{\%}-100{\%} for correct identification of errant transitions. The algorithm was robust when challenged with multiple types of interferences and problematic transitions.

CONCLUSIONS: This algorithm for automated detection of inaccurate and imprecise transitions (AuDIT) in MRM-MS data reduces the time required for manual and subjective inspection of data, improves the overall accuracy of data analysis, and is easily implemented into the standard data-analysis work flow. AuDIT currently works with results exported from MRM-MS data-processing software packages and may be implemented as an analysis tool within such software.},

abstract = {Aging is believed to be a nonadaptive process that escapes the force of natural selection. Here, we challenge this dogma by showing that yeast laboratory strains and strains isolated from grapes undergo an age- and pH-dependent death with features of mammalian programmed cell death (apoptosis). After 90-99{\%} of the population dies, a small mutant subpopulation uses the nutrients released by dead cells to grow. This adaptive regrowth is inversely correlated with protection against superoxide toxicity and life span and is associated with elevated age-dependent release of nutrients and increased mutation frequency. Computational simulations confirm that premature aging together with a relatively high mutation frequency can result in a major advantage in adaptation to changing environments. These results suggest that under conditions that model natural environments, yeast organisms undergo an altruistic and premature aging and death program, mediated in part by superoxide. The role of similar pathways in the regulation of longevity in organisms ranging from yeast to mice raises the possibility that mammals may also undergo programmed aging.},

abstract = {Which transcription factors control the distribution of metabolic fluxes under a given condition? We address this question by systematically quantifying metabolic fluxes in 119 transcription factor deletion mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under five growth conditions. While most knockouts did not affect fluxes, we identified 42 condition-dependent interactions that were mediated by a total of 23 transcription factors that control almost exclusively the cellular decision between respiration and fermentation. This relatively sparse, condition-specific network of active metabolic control contrasts with the much larger gene regulation network inferred from expression and DNA binding data. Based on protein and transcript analyses in key mutants, we identified three enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle as the key targets of this transcriptional control. For the transcription factor Gcn4, we demonstrate that this control is mediated through the PKA and Snf1 signaling cascade. The discrepancy between flux response predictions, based on the known regulatory network architecture and our functional (13)C-data, demonstrates the importance of identifying and quantifying the extent to which regulatory effectors alter cellular functions.},

More recently the democratization of comprehensive proteomics technologies is enabling the determination of the cellular phenotype and the molecular events that define its dynamic state. Core proteomic technologies include MS to define protein sequence, protein:protein interactions, and protein PTMs. Key enabling technologies for proteomics are bioinformatic pipelines to identify, quantitate, and summarize these events. The Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) is a robust open-source standardized data processing pipeline for large-scale reproducible quantitative MS proteomics. It supports all major operating systems and instrument vendors via open data formats. Here, we provide a review of the overall proteomics workflow supported by the TPP, its major tools, and how it can be used in its various modes from desktop to cloud computing. We describe new features for the TPP, including data visualization functionality. We conclude by describing some common perils that affect the analysis of MS/MS datasets, as well as some major upcoming features.},

The minimum apoptosis-activating intracellular concentration of horse heart cytochrome c was estimated to be 2.7 +/- 0.5 microM (47 +/- 9 fg/cell). The equieffective concentrations of the K72A-, K72E- and K72L-substituted mutants of cytochrome c were five-, 15- and 70-fold higher. The "yeast --> horse" hybrid created by introducing S2D, K4E, A7K, T8K, and K11V substitutions (horse protein numbering) and deleting five N-terminal residues in yeast cytochrome c did not evoke apoptotic activity in mammalian cells. The apoptotic function of cytochrome c was abolished by the K72W substitution. The K72W-substituted cytochrome c possesses reduced affinity to the apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and forms an inactive complex. This mutant is competent as a respiratory-chain electron carrier and well suited for knock-in studies of cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis.},

The high degree of sequence relatedness between the ALS genes and the tremendous allelic variability often present in the same C. albicans strain complicated definition and characterization of the gene family. The main hypothesis driving ALS family research is that the genes encode adhesins, primarily involved in host-pathogen interactions. Although adhesive function has been demonstrated for several Als proteins, the challenge of studying putative adhesins in a highly adhesive organism like C. albicans has led to varying ideas about how best to pursue such investigations, and results that are sometimes contradictory. Recent analysis of alsdelta/alsdelta strains suggested roles for Als proteins outside of adhesion to host surfaces, and a broader scope of Als protein function than commonly believed. The availability and use of experimental methodologies to study C. albicans at the genomic level, and the ALS family en masse, have advanced knowledge of these genes and emphasized their importance in C. albicans biology and pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Human blood plasma can be obtained relatively noninvasively and contains proteins from most, if not all, tissues of the body. Therefore, an extensive, quantitative catalog of plasma proteins is an important starting point for the discovery of disease biomarkers. In 2005, we showed that different proteomics measurements using different sample preparation and analysis techniques identify significantly different sets of proteins, and that a comprehensive plasma proteome can be compiled only by combining data from many different experiments. Applying advanced computational methods developed for the analysis and integration of very large and diverse data sets generated by tandem MS measurements of tryptic peptides, we have now compiled a high-confidence human plasma proteome reference set with well over twice the identified proteins of previous high-confidence sets. It includes a hierarchy of protein identifications at different levels of redundancy following a clearly defined scheme, which we propose as a standard that can be applied to any proteomics data set to facilitate cross-proteome analyses. Further, to aid in development of blood-based diagnostics using techniques such as selected reaction monitoring, we provide a rough estimate of protein concentrations using spectral counting. We identified 20,433 distinct peptides, from which we inferred a highly nonredundant set of 1929 protein sequences at a false discovery rate of 1{\%}. We have made this resource available via PeptideAtlas, a large, multiorganism, publicly accessible compendium of peptides identified in tandem MS experiments conducted by laboratories around the world.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples. CR  - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1995 Royal Statistical Society},

abstract = {\textit{Candida albicans} is the most common human fungal pathogen. Recent evidence has revealed the occurrence of apoptosis in C. albicans that is inducible by environmental stresses such as hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and amphotericin B. Apoptosis is regulated by the calcineurin-caspase pathway in C. albicans, and calcineurin is under the control of Hsp90 in echinocandin resistance. However, the role of Hsp90 in apoptosis of C. albicans remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Hsp90 in apoptosis of C. albicans by using an Hsp90-compromised strain tetO-HSP90/hsp90 and found that upon apoptotic stimuli, including hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid or amphotericin B treatment, less apoptosis occurred, less ROS was produced, and more cells survived in the Hsp90-compromised strain compared with the Hsp90/Hsp90 wild-type strain. In addition, Hsp90-compromised cells were defective in up-regulating caspase-encoding gene CaMCA1 expression and activating caspase activity upon the apoptotic stimuli. Investigations on the relationship between Hsp90 and calcineurin revealed that activation of calcineurin could up-regulate apoptosis but could not further down-regulate apoptosis in Hsp90-compromised cells, indicating that calcineurin was downstream of Hsp90. Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GdA) could further decrease the apoptosis in calcineurin-pathway-defect strains, indicating that compromising Hsp90 function had a stronger effect than compromising calcineurin function on apoptosis. Collectively, this study demonstrated that compromised Hsp90 reduced apoptosis in C. albicans, partially through downregulating the calcineurin-caspase pathway.},

abstract = {Targeted proteomics via selected reaction monitoring is a powerful mass spectrometric technique affording higher dynamic range, increased specificity and lower limits of detection than other shotgun mass spectrometry methods when applied to proteome analyses. However, it involves selective measurement of predetermined analytes, which requires more preparation in the form of selecting appropriate signatures for the proteins and peptides that are to be targeted. There is a growing number of software programs and resources for selecting optimal transitions and the instrument settings used for the detection and quantification of the targeted peptides, but the exchange of this information is hindered by a lack of a standard format. We have developed a new standardized format, called TraML, for encoding transition lists and associated metadata. In addition to introducing the TraML format, we demonstrate several implementations across the community, and provide semantic validators, extensive documentation, and multiple example instances to demonstrate correctly written documents. Widespread use of TraML will facilitate the exchange of transitions, reduce time spent handling incompatible list formats, increase the reusability of previously optimized transitions, and thus accelerate the widespread adoption of targeted proteomics via selected reaction monitoring.},

In-gel digestion yields more comprehensive proteomic and protein coverage of membrane/membrane raft samples, for example by LC-MS/MS of protein samples resolved by 1D SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Although this type of analysis can be performed quantitatively by labelling at the protein level, for instance by SILAC, the separation of proteins on a resolving gel complicates the application of other quantitative methods that employ post-digestion labelling techniques. This chapter describes an alternative protocol to prepare membrane or membrane raft protein samples to be isolated, but not separated, as unresolved bands in a gel. Focusing as a single band enables the confident excision of different samples in their entirety, to be digested, labelled, and fractionated for quantitative mass spectrometric analysis.},

abstract = {Systemic candidiasis remains a major cause of disease and death, particularly among patients suffering from hematological malignancies. In an attempt to contribute to the discovery of useful biomarkers for its diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring, we embarked on a mapping of \textit{Candida albicans} immunogenic proteins specifically recognized by antibodies produced during the natural course of systemic Candida infection in this high-risk population. About 85 immunoreactive protein species were detected with systemic candidiasis patients' serum specimens by using immunoproteomics (i.e., two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by Western blotting), and identified through a combination of peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), de novo peptide sequencing using nano-electrospray ionization-ion trap (ESI-IT) MS, and genomic database searches. This proteomic approach has led to the characterization of 42 different housekeeping enzymes as C. albicans antigens. Their biological significance is also discussed. Furthermore, this study is the first to report that 26 of them exhibit antigenic properties in C. albicans, and 35 of them become targets of the human antibody response to systemic candidiasis. Our findings suggest that the production of antibodies to C. albicans phosphoglycerate kinase and alcohol dehydrogenase during systemic candidiasis could be associated with a differentiation of the human immune response. We also highlight the relationship between changes in maintenance of circulating levels of specific anti-Candida antibodies and patients' outcome. Some of these variations, especially the rise of high anti-enolase antibody concentrations, appear to be related to recovery from systemic candidiasis in these patients, which might serve as markers for predicting their outcome. This approach could therefore provide new challenges for diagnosis and clinical follow-up of these fungal infections, and even for antifungal drug or vaccine design.},

abstract = {The term proteomics encompasses the large-scale detection and analysis of proteins and their post-translational modifications. Driven by major improvements in mass spectrometric instrumentation, methodology and data analysis, the proteomics field has burgeoned in recent years. It now provides a range of sensitive and quantitative approaches for measuring protein structures and dynamics that promise to revolutionize our understanding of cell biology and molecular mechanisms in both human cells and model organisms. The Proteomics Specification in Time and Space (PROSPECTS) Network is a unique EU-funded project that brings together leading European research groups, spanning from instrumentation to biomedicine, in a collaborative five year initiative to develop new methods and applications for the functional analysis of cellular proteins. This special issue of Molecular and Cellular Proteomics presents 16 research papers reporting major recent progress by the PROSPECTS groups, including improvements to the resolution and sensitivity of the Orbitrap family of mass spectrometers, systematic detection of proteins using highly characterized antibody collections and new methods for absolute as well as relative quantification of protein levels. Manuscripts in this issue exemplify approaches for performing quantitative measurements of cell proteomes and for studying their dynamic responses to perturbation, both during normal cellular responses and in disease mechanisms. Here we present a perspective on how the proteomics field is moving beyond simply identifying proteins with high sensitivity towards providing a powerful and versatile set of assay systems for characterizing proteome dynamics and thereby creating a new third generation proteomics strategy that offers an indispensible tool for cell biology and molecular medicine.},

The tools perform proteomics data analyses; the libraries enable rapid tool creation by providing a robust, pluggable development framework that simplifies and unifies data file access, and performs standard proteomics and LCMS dataset computations. The library contains readers and writers of the mzML data format, which has been written using modern C++ techniques and design principles and supports a variety of platforms with native compilers. The software has been specifically released under the Apache v2 license to ensure it can be used in both academic and commercial projects. In addition to the library, we also introduce a rapidly growing set of companion tools whose implementation helps to illustrate the simplicity of developing applications on top of the ProteoWizard library.

AVAILABILITY: Cross-platform software that compiles using native compilers (i.e. GCC on Linux, MSVC on Windows and XCode on OSX) is available for download free of charge, at http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net. This website also provides code examples, and documentation. It is our hope the ProteoWizard project will become a standard platform for proteomics development; consequently, code use, contribution and further development are strongly encouraged.},

abstract = {The combination of tandem mass spectrometry and sequence database searching is the method of choice for the identification of peptides and the mapping of proteomes. Over the last several years, the volume of data generated in proteomic studies has increased dramatically, which challenges the computational approaches previously developed for these data. Furthermore, a multitude of search engines have been developed that identify different, overlapping subsets of the sample peptides from a particular set of tandem mass spectrometry spectra. We present iProphet, the new addition to the widely used open-source suite of proteomic data analysis tools Trans-Proteomics Pipeline. Applied in tandem with PeptideProphet, it provides more accurate representation of the multilevel nature of shotgun proteomic data. iProphet combines the evidence from multiple identifications of the same peptide sequences across different spectra, experiments, precursor ion charge states, and modified states. It also allows accurate and effective integration of the results from multiple database search engines applied to the same data. The use of iProphet in the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline increases the number of correctly identified peptides at a constant false discovery rate as compared with both PeptideProphet and another state-of-the-art tool Percolator. As the main outcome, iProphet permits the calculation of accurate posterior probabilities and false discovery rate estimates at the level of sequence identical peptide identifications, which in turn leads to more accurate probability estimates at the protein level. Fully integrated with the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline, it supports all commonly used MS instruments, search engines, and computer platforms. The performance of iProphet is demonstrated on two publicly available data sets: data from a human whole cell lysate proteome profiling experiment representative of typical proteomic data sets, and from a set of Streptococcus pyogenes experiments more representative of organism-specific composite data sets.},

Under certain circumstances, however, C. albicans can cause infections that range from superficial infections of the skin to life-threatening systemic infections. Several factors and activities have been identified which contribute to the pathogenic potential of this fungus. Among them are molecules which mediate adhesion to and invasion into host cells, the secretion of hydrolases, the yeast-to-hypha transition, contact sensing and thigmotropism, biofilm formation, phenotypic switching and a range of fitness attributes. Our understanding of when and how these mechanisms and factors contribute to infection has significantly increased during the last years. In addition, novel virulence mechanisms have recently been discovered. In this review we present an update on our current understanding of the pathogenicity mechanisms of this important human pathogen.},

We report here the creation of a C. albicans PeptideAtlas comprising near 22,000 distinct peptides at a 0.24{\%} False Discovery Rate (FDR) that account for over 2500 canonical proteins at a 1.2{\%} FDR. Based on data from 16 experiments, we attained coverage of 41{\%} of the C. albicans open reading frame sequences (ORFs) in the database used for the searches. This PeptideAtlas provides several useful features, including comprehensive protein and peptide-centered search capabilities and visualization tools that establish a solid basis for the study of basic biological mechanisms key to virulence and pathogenesis such as dimorphism, adherence, and apoptosis. Further, it is a valuable resource for the selection of candidate proteotypic peptides for targeted proteomic experiments via Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) or SWATH-MS.

BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This C. albicans PeptideAtlas resolves the previous absence of fungal pathogens in the PeptideAtlas project. It represents the most extensive characterization of the proteome of this fungus that exists up to the current date, including evidence for uncharacterized ORFs. Through its web interface, PeptideAtlas supports the study of interesting proteins related to basic biological mechanisms key to virulence such as apoptosis, dimorphism and adherence. It also provides a valuable resource to select candidate proteotypic peptides for future (SRM) targeted proteomic experiments.

We applied this approach to profile the absolute levels of key TFs, including PPAR$\gamma$ and RXR$\alpha$, during terminal differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Our analyses revealed that individual TF abundance differs dramatically (from ∼250 to >300,000 copies per nucleus) and that their dynamic range during differentiation can vary up to fivefold. We also formulated a DNA binding model for PPAR$\gamma$ based on TF copy number, binding energetics and local chromatin state. This model explains the increase in PPAR$\gamma$ binding sites during the final differentiation stage that occurs despite a concurrent saturation in PPAR$\gamma$ copy number.},

abstract = {The opportunistic human fungal pathogen \textit{Candida albicans} causes a wide variety of infections including deep systemic syndromes. The C. albicans plasma membrane is an important interface in the host-pathogen relationship. The plasma membrane proteins mediate a variety of functions, including sensing and signalling to the external environment, in which the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins play a crucial role. A subproteomic approach to obtain a global picture of the protein composition of the C. albicans plasma membrane was developed, and different strategies were tested in order to extract the largest number of yeast plasma membrane proteins and GPI-anchored membrane proteins. These methods involved: (i) protoplast generation, (ii) mechanical disruption, (iii) ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, and (iv) Na(2)CO(3) treatments. To isolate GPI-anchored proteins two additional steps were performed: two-phase separation and phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment. After LC-MS/MS analysis using both a MALDI-TOF/TOF and a linear ion trap quadrupole, a total of 214 membrane proteins were identified, including 41 already described as plasma membrane proteins, 20 plasma membrane associated proteins, and 22 proteins with unknown membrane localisation. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that this set of C. albicans membrane proteins is highly enriched in proteins involved in biopolymer biosynthesis or transport processes. Furthermore, after phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment, 12 GPI-anchored membrane proteins were released and identified; most of them are associated with cell wall beta-glucan synthesis and maintenance or are virulence factors, such as phospholipases or aspartyl proteinases.},

abstract = {In many studies, particularly in the field of systems biology, it is essential that identical protein sets are precisely quantified in multiple samples such as those representing differentially perturbed cell states. The high degree of reproducibility required for such experiments has not been achieved by classical mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods. In this study we describe the implementation of a targeted quantitative approach by which predetermined protein sets are first identified and subsequently quantified at high sensitivity reliably in multiple samples. This approach consists of three steps. First, the proteome is extensively mapped out by multidimensional fractionation and tandem mass spectrometry, and the data generated are assembled in the PeptideAtlas database. Second, based on this proteome map, peptides uniquely identifying the proteins of interest, proteotypic peptides, are selected, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions are established and validated by MS2 spectrum acquisition. This process of peptide selection, transition selection, and validation is supported by a suite of software tools, TIQAM (Targeted Identification for Quantitative Analysis by MRM), described in this study. Third, the selected target protein set is quantified in multiple samples by MRM. Applying this approach we were able to reliably quantify low abundance virulence factors from cultures of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes exposed to increasing amounts of plasma. The resulting quantitative protein patterns enabled us to clearly define the subset of virulence proteins that is regulated upon plasma exposure.},

The so-called tissue leakage factors reveal information about the tissue from which they originate and are therefore of great potential importance as disease biomarkers. There are already a number of blood-borne biomarkers in routine clinical use that aid in the diagnosis or management of cancer. However, there is a pressing need for additional markers, and new methods to find them are under development. Here we provide a protocol for serum protein profiling using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Included in this procedure, we detail the pre-processing steps of lipid and high-abundance protein removal. These procedures can also be employed up-stream of quantification methods such as isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). Chapter 12 is devoted to the iTRAQ approach for quantifying proteins, and it is therefore not described in this chapter.},

abstract = {Quantifying the similarity of spectra is an important task in various areas of spectroscopy, e.g. to identify a compound by comparing sample spectra to those of reference standards. In mass spectrometry based discovery proteomics, spectral comparisons are used to infer the amino acid sequence of peptides. In targeted proteomics by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) or SWATH MS, predetermined sets of fragment ion signals integrated over chromatographic time are used to identify target peptides in complex samples. In both cases, confidence in peptide identification is directly related to the quality of spectral matches. In this study, we used sets of simulated spectra of well-controlled dissimilarity to benchmark different spectral comparison measures and to develop a robust scoring scheme that quantifies the similarity of fragment ion spectra. We applied the normalized contrast spectral angle score to quantify the similarity of spectra to objectively assess fragment ion variability of tandem mass spectrometric datasets, to evaluate portability of peptide fragment ion spectra for targeted mass spectrometry across different types of mass spectrometers and to discriminate target assays from decoys in targeted proteomics. Altogether, this study validates the use of the normalized spectral contrast angle as a sensitive spectral similarity measure for targeted proteomics, and more generally provides a methodology to assess the performance of spectral comparisons and to support the rational selection of the most appropriate similarity measure. The algorithms used in this study are made publicly available as an open source toolset with a graphical user interface.},

abstract = {Proteome analysis is most commonly accomplished by a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) to separate and visualize proteins and mass spectrometry (MS) for protein identification. Although this technique is powerful, mature, and sensitive, questions remain concerning its ability to characterize all of the elements of a proteome. In the current study, more than 1,500 features were visualized by silver staining a narrow pH range (4.9-5. 7) 2D gel in which 0.5 mg of total soluble yeast protein was separated. Fifty spots migrating to a region of 4 cm(2) were subjected to MS protein identification. Despite the high sample load and extended electrophoretic separation, proteins from genes with codon bias values of <0.1 (lower abundance proteins) were not found, even though fully one-half of all yeast genes fall into that range. Proteins from genes with codon bias values of <0.1 were found, however, if protein amounts exceeding the capacity of 2DE were fractionated and analyzed. We conclude that the large range of protein expression levels limits the ability of the 2DE-MS approach to analyze proteins of medium to low abundance, and thus the potential of this technique for proteome analysis is likewise limited.},

@article{Leger2015,
abstract = {Manipulating the apoptotic response of \textit{Candida albicans} may help in the control of this opportunistic pathogen. The metacaspase Mca1p has been described as a key protease for apoptosis in C. albicans but little is known about its cleavage specificity and substrates. We therefore initiated a series of studies to describe its function. We used a strain disrupted for the MCA1 gene (mca1$\Delta$/$\Delta$) and compared its proteome to that of a wild-type isogenic strain, in the presence and absence of a known inducer of apoptosis, the quorum-sensing molecule farnesol. Label-free and TMT labeling quantitative proteomic analyses showed that both mca1 disruption and farnesol treatment significantly affected the proteome of the cells. The combination of both conditions led to an unexpected biological response: the strong overexpression of proteins implicated in the general stress. We studied sites cleaved by Mca1p using native peptidomic techniques, and a bottom-up approach involving GluC endoprotease: there appeared to be a "K/R" substrate specificity in P1 and a "D/E" specificity in P2. We also found 77 potential substrates of Mca1p, 13 of which validated using the most stringent filters, implicated in protein folding, protein aggregate resolubilization, glycolysis, and a number of mitochondrial functions. An immunoblot assay confirmed the cleavage of Ssb1p, a member of the HSP70 family of heat-shock proteins, in conditions where the metacaspase is activated. These various results indicate that Mca1p is involved in a limited and specific proteolysis program triggered by apoptosis. One of the main functions of Mca1p appears to be the degradation of several major heat-shock proteins, thereby contributing to weakening cellular defenses and amplifying the cell death process. Finally, Mca1p appears to contribute significantly to the control of mitochondria biogenesis and degradation. Consequently, Mca1p may be a link between the extrinsic and the intrinsic programmed cell death pathways in C. albicans.},

SILAC has been applied to numerous different cell lines and the technique has been adapted for a wide range of experimental procedures.

At the same time advances in protein and DNA sequencing technology are resulting in an exponential increase in the number of sequences deposited in databases. Here we investigate the possibility to use mass spectrometric data to identify proteins in databases. Searching a database by total molecular weight is found to be an easy and sometimes sufficient approach. For more specificity and for error tolerance in both the mass spectrometric data and the database information we search by partial mass spectrometric peptide map of the protein. In general, just four to six proteolytic peptides measured with a mass accuracy between 0.1 and 0.01{\%} allow a useful search of databases such as the Protein Identification Resource (PIR). As the size of DNA and protein sequence databases grows, protein identification by partial mass spectrometric peptide maps should become increasingly powerful and may become a general method to identify and characterize proteins.},

They are more resistant to the action of non-anionic detergents, and are called, for this reason, detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Lipid rafts are involved in many cellular processes, like signaling, cytokinesis, response to environment, etc., and therefore must contain important proteins. We have obtained a fraction enriched in proteins from \textit{Candida albicans} DRMs. The sample has been analyzed by SDS-PAGE and 29 proteins have been identified including markers for lipid rafts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, like Pma1p and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein belonging to the Phr family. Ecm33p, a GPI-anchored protein involved in cell wall biogenesis, has been found for the first time in lipid rafts.

The same protein may thereby fulfill different functions depending on its binding partners.

Different quantitative MS strategies have been used to characterize protein interaction networks. In this chapter we describe in detail the use of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for the quantitative analysis of stimulus-dependent dynamic protein interactions.},

The detection range can be extended to single-digit copies/cell and to proteins undetected by classical methods. We illustrate the power of the technique by the consistent and fast measurement of a network of proteins spanning the entire abundance range over a growth time course of S. cerevisiae transiting through a series of metabolic phases. We therefore demonstrate the potential of SRM-based proteomics to provide assays for the measurement of any set of proteins of interest in yeast at high-throughput and quantitative accuracy.},

As an important stepping stone toward such understanding, we exploit the power of proteomics assays based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry to quantify abundance changes of the 228 proteins that constitute the central carbon and amino-acid metabolic network in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at five different metabolic steady states. Overall, 90{\%} of the targeted proteins, including families of isoenzymes, were consistently detected and quantified in each sample, generating a proteomic data set that represents a nutritionally perturbed biological system at high reproducibility. The data set is near comprehensive because we detect 95-99{\%} of all proteins that are required under a given condition. Interpreted through flux balance modeling, the data indicate that S. cerevisiae retains proteins not necessarily used in a particular environment. Further, the data suggest differential functionality for several metabolic isoenzymes.},

The gist of the method is to flow protein solutions under an immobilised pH gradient gel (IPG) through which an electric field is applied perpendicular to the direction of the flow. Due to the buffering capacity of the IPG gel, proteins with an isoelectric point (pI) close to pH of the gel in contact with the flow chamber stay in solution because they are neutral and therefore not extracted by the electric field. Other proteins will be charged when approaching the IPG gel and are extracted into the gel by the electric field. Both a demonstration experiment with pI markers and a simulation of the electric field distribution are presented to highlight the principle of the system. In addition, an isoelectric fractionation of an Escherichia coli extract is shown to illustrate the possible applications.},

The specificity and sensitivity of the approach, as well as its capability to multiplex the measurement of many analytes in parallel, has made it a technology of particular promise for hypothesis driven proteomics. An underappreciated step in the development of an assay to measure many peptides in parallel is the time and effort necessary to establish a usable assay. Here we report the use of shotgun proteomics data to expedite the selection of SRM transitions for target peptides of interest. The use of tandem mass spectrometry data acquired on an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer can accurately predict which fragment ions will produce the greatest signal in an SRM assay using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Furthermore, we present a scoring routine that can compare the targeted SRM chromatogram data with an MS/MS spectrum acquired by data-dependent acquisition and stored in a library. This scoring routine is invaluable in determining which signal in the chromatogram from a complex mixture best represents the target peptide. These algorithmic developments have been implemented in a software package that is available from the authors upon request.},

Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

In an SRM experiment, a predefined precursor ion and one of its fragments are selected by the two mass filters of a triple quadrupole instrument and monitored over time for precise quantification. A series of transitions (precursor/fragment ion pairs) in combination with the retention time of the targeted peptide can constitute a definitive assay. Typically, a large number of peptides are quantified during a single LC-MS experiment. This tutorial explains the application of SRM for quantitative proteomics, including the selection of proteotypic peptides and the optimization and validation of transitions. Furthermore, normalization and various factors affecting sensitivity and accuracy are discussed.},

The library is optimized to be used in conjunction with mzIdentML, the recently released standard data format for reporting protein and peptide identifications, developed by the HUPO proteomics standards initiative (PSI). mzIdentML files do not contain spectra data but contain references to different kinds of external MS data files. As a key functionality, all parsers implement a common interface that supports the various methods used by mzIdentML to reference external spectra. Thus, when developing software for mzIdentML, programmers no longer have to support multiple MS data file formats but only this one interface. The library (which includes a viewer) is open source and, together with detailed documentation, can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/jmzreader/.},

@article{MacLean2006,
abstract = {Motivation: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) identifies protein sequences using database search engines, at the core of which is a score that measures the similarity between peptide MS/MS spectra and a protein sequence database. The TANDEM application was developed as a freely available database search engine for the proteomics research community. To extend TANDEM as a platform for further research on developing improved database scoring methods, we modified the software to allow users to redefine the scoring function and replace the native TANDEM scoring function while leaving the remaining core application intact. Redefinition is performed at run time so multiple scoring functions are available to be selected and applied from a single search engine binary. We introduce the implementation of the pluggable scoring algorithm and also provide implementations of two TANDEM compatible scoring functions, one previously described scoring function compatible with PeptideProphet and one very simple scoring function that quantitative researchers may use to begin their development. This extension builds on the open-source TANDEM project and will facilitate research into and dissemination of novel algorithms for matching MS/MS spectra to peptide sequences. The pluggable scoring schema is also compatible with related search applications P3 and Hunter, which are part of the X! suite of database matching algorithms. The pluggable scores and the X! suite of applications are all written in C++. Contact:mmcintosh@fhcrc.org Availability: Source code for the scoring functions is available from http://proteomics.fhcrc.org Supplementary information:http://proteomics.fhcrc.org},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based methods for the identification of proteins are fundamental platform technologies for proteomics. One comprehensive approach is to subject trypsinized peptides to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to obtain detailed structural information. Different strategies are available for interpreting MS/MS data and hence deducing the amino acid sequence of the peptides. The most common method is to use a search algorithm to identify peptides by correlating experimental and theoretical MS/MS data (the latter being generated from possible peptides in the protein sequence database). Identified peptides are collated and protein entries from the sequence database inferred. This unit focuses on the most widely used tandem MS peptide identification search algorithms (commercial and open source), their availability, ease of use, strengths, speed and scoring, as well as their relative sensitivity and specificity.},

Within the set of {\~{}}20,000 neXtProt primary entries, 14,070 (70{\%}) are confidently detected in the latest build, 5{\%} are ambiguous, 9{\%} are redundant, leaving the total percentage of proteins for which there are no mapping detections at just 16{\%} (3166), all derived from over 133 million peptide-spectrum matches identifying more than 1 million distinct peptides using AtlasProphet to characterize and classify the protein matches. Improved handling for detection and presentation of single amino-acid variants (SAAVs) reveals the detection of 5,326 uniquely mapping SAAVs across 2,794 proteins. With such a large amount of data, the control of false positives is a challenge. We present the methodology and results for maintaining rigorous quality, along with a discussion of the implications of the remaining sources of errors in the build.

The technique was tested under a number of different conditions to find those best for our purpose; they may represent some general improvements in the method. The protein patterns show high resolution and excellent reproducibility. About 275 spots were found for fetal liver, about 230 for whole embryos (day 14 p.c.) and about 100 for serum. The fact that a high number of protein spots can be evaluated by a single and comparatively simple experiment suggests that this method may be useful as an assay system for induced point mutations. The protein patterns demonstrated are compared and discgs of dominant lethal examinations after acute and subacute application of these three substances.},

Based on our previous finding that transcription factor Cap1p was involved in baicalein-induced apoptosis, the present study aimed to further clarify the role of Cap1p in apoptosis by observing the impact of CAP1 deletion on cell fate. It was found that apoptotic stimulation with amphotericin B, acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells, caspase activity and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, whereas it decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP level in the cap1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant. The cell fate was, at least partly, caused by glutathione depletion and attenuation of the expression of the glutathione reductase gene in the cap1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant. Collectively, our data suggest that Cap1p participated in the apoptosis of C. albicans by regulating the expression of the glutathione reductase gene and glutathione content.},

Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},

Therefore a need for specific enrichment of phosphorylated peptides or proteins exists. Significant progress surrounding the biochemical analysis of reversible protein phosphorylation in the past years has led to the development of several new techniques to isolate or enrich phosphopeptides, particularly in large-scale analyses.

abstract = {We present a statistical model to estimate the accuracy of peptide assignments to tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra made by database search applications such as SEQUEST. Employing the expectation maximization algorithm, the analysis learns to distinguish correct from incorrect database search results, computing probabilities that peptide assignments to spectra are correct based upon database search scores and the number of tryptic termini of peptides. Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides. This analysis makes it possible to filter large volumes of MS/MS database search results with predictable false identification error rates and can serve as a common standard by which the results of different research groups are compared.},

The theory and rationale behind the mixture-modeling approach taken by PeptideProphet is discussed from a statistical model-building perspective followed by a description of how a model can be used to express confidence in the identification of individual peptides or sets of peptides. We also demonstrate how to evaluate the quality of model fit and select an appropriate model from several available alternatives.

abstract = {The two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) technique developed by Klose in 1975 (Humangenetik 1975, 26, 211-234), independently of the technique developed by O'Farrell (J. Biol. Chem. 1975, 250, 4007-4021), has been revised in our laboratory and an updated protocol is presented. This protocol is the result of our experience in using this method since its introduction. Many modifications and suggestions found in the literature were also tested and then integrated into our original method if advantageous. Gel and buffer composition, size of gels, use of stacking gels or not, necessity of isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel incubation, freezing of IEF gels or immediate use, carrier ampholytes versus Immobilines, regulation of electric current, conditions for staining and drying the gels - these and other problems were the subject of our concern. Among the technical details and special equipment which constitute our 2-DE method presented here, a few features are of particular significance: (i) sample loading onto the acid side of the IEF gel with the result that both acidic and basic proteins are well resolved in the same gel; (ii) use of large (46 x 30 cm) gels to achieve high resolution, but without the need of unusually large, flat gel equipment; (iii) preparation of ready-made gel solutions which can be stored frozen, a prerequisite, among others, for high reproducibility. Using the 2-DE method described we demonstrate that protein patterns revealing more than 10 000 polypeptide spots can be obtained from mouse tissues. This is by far the highest resolution so far reported in the literature for 2-DE of complex protein mixtures. The 2-DE patterns were of high quality with regard to spot shape and background. The reproducibility of the protein patterns is demonstrated and shown to be thoroughly satisfactory. An example is given to show how effectively 2-DE of high resolution and reproducibility can be used to study the genetic variability of proteins in an interspecific mouse backcross (Mus musculus x Mus spretus) established by the European Backcross Collaborative Group for mapping the mouse genome. We outline our opinion that the structural analysis of the human genome, currently pursued most intensively on a worldwide scale, should be accompanied by a functional analysis of the genome that starts from the proteins of the organism.},

abstract = {Targeted proteomics allows researchers to study proteins of interest without being drowned in data from other, less interesting proteins or from redundant or uninformative peptides. While the technique is mostly used for smaller, focused studies, there are several reasons to conduct larger targeted experiments. Automated, highly robust software becomes more important in such experiments. In addition, larger experiments are carried out over longer periods of time, requiring strategies to handle the sometimes large shift in retention time often observed. We present a complete proof-of-principle software stack that automates most aspects of selected reaction monitoring workflows, a targeted proteomics technology. The software allows experiments to be easily designed and carried out. The steps automated are the generation of assays, generation of mass spectrometry driver files and methods files, and the import and analysis of the data. All data are normalized to a common retention time scale, the data are then scored using a novel score model, and the error is subsequently estimated. We also show that selected reaction monitoring can be used for label-free quantification. All data generated are stored in a relational database, and the growing resource further facilitates the design of new experiments. We apply the technology to a large-scale experiment studying how Streptococcus pyogenes remodels its proteome under stimulation of human plasma.},

@article{Kirkpatrick2005,
abstract = {Advances in biological mass spectrometry have resulted in the development of numerous strategies for the large-scale quantification of protein expression levels within cells. These measurements of protein expression are most commonly accomplished through differential incorporation of stable isotopes into cellular proteins. Several variations of the stable isotope quantification method have been demonstrated, differing in isotope composition and incorporation strategy. In general, the majority of these methods establish only relative quantification of expressed proteins. To address this, the absolute quantification (AQUA) strategy was developed for the precise determination of protein expression and post-translational modification levels. The AQUA method relies on the use of a synthetic internal standard peptide that is introduced at a known concentration to cell lysates during digestion. This AQUA peptide precisely mimics a peptide produced during proteolysis of the target protein, except that it is enriched in certain stable isotopes. Analysis of the proteolyzed sample by a selected reaction monitoring (SRM) experiment in a tandem mass spectrometer results in the direct detection and quantification of both the native peptide and isotope labeled AQUA internal standard peptide. As an example, the development and application of a method to measure a tryptic peptide representing the amount of polyubiquitin chain formation through lysine 48 (K48) is presented. The simplicity and sensitivity of the method, coupled with the widespread availability of tandem mass spectrometers, make the AQUA strategy a highly useful procedure for measuring the levels of proteins and post-translational modifications directly from cell lysates.},

Using >600,000 peptide identifications generated by four proteomic platforms, we empirically identified >16,000 proteotypic peptides for 4,030 distinct yeast proteins. Characteristic physicochemical properties of these peptides were used to develop a computational tool that can predict proteotypic peptides for any protein from any organism, for a given platform, with >85{\%} cumulative accuracy. Possible applications of proteotypic peptides include validation of protein identifications, absolute quantification of proteins, annotation of coding sequences in genomes, and characterization of the physical principles governing key elements of mass spectrometric workflows (e.g., digestion, chromatography, ionization and fragmentation).},

abstract = {Caspofungin exerts candidacidal activity by inhibiting cell wall (1,3)-$\beta$-d-glucan synthesis. We investigated the physiologic mechanisms of caspofungin-induced \textit{Candida albicans} cell death. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) and necrosis were studied after C. albicans SC5314 cells were exposed to caspofungin at 0.06, 0.125, and 0.5 $\mu$g/ml (0.5×, 1×, and 4× the MIC, respectively) for 3 h. Caspofungin at 0.125 and 0.5 $\mu$g/ml reduced cellular viability by >50{\%}, as measured by colony counts and methylene blue exclusion. Apoptosis and necrosis were demonstrated by annexin V and propidium iodide staining for phosphatidylserine externalization and loss of membrane integrity, respectively. At all concentrations of caspofungin, 20 to 25{\%} and 5 to 7{\%} of C. albicans cells exhibited early apoptosis and late apoptosis/necrosis, respectively (P value was not significant [NS]). Necrosis, on the other hand, was significantly greater at 0.125 (43{\%}) and 0.5 (48{\%}) $\mu$g/ml than at 0.06 $\mu$g/ml (26{\%}) (P values of 0.003 and 0.003, respectively). The induction of apoptosis at concentrations less than or equal to the MIC was corroborated by dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR-123) and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining (reactive oxygen species production), JC-1 staining (mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining (DNA damage and nuclear fragmentation). Moreover, electron microscopy of cells exposed to 0.125 $\mu$g/ml of caspofungin showed hallmark apoptotic features like chromatin margination and condensation and nuclear blebs. Apoptosis was associated with metacaspase 1 activation, as demonstrated by D2R staining. Caspofungin exerts activity against C. albicans by directly killing cells (resulting in necrosis) and causing others to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Apoptosis is initiated at subinhibitory concentrations, suggesting that strategies to target this process may augment the benefits of antifungal agents.},

abstract = {Protein relative quantification is a key facet of many proteomics experiments. Several methods exist for this type of work, some of which are described elsewhere in this volume. In this chapter we will describe the use of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). These chemical tags attach to all peptides in a protein digest via free amines at the peptide N-terminus and on the side chain of lysine residues. Labelled samples are then pooled and analysed simultaneously. Since the tags are isobaric, labelled peptides do not show a mass shift in MS, instead signal from the same peptide from all samples is summed, providing a moderate increase in sensitivity. Upon peptide fragmentation, sequence ions (b- and y-type) also show this summed intensity which aids sensitivity. However, the distribution of isotopes in the different tags is such that when the tags fragment a tag-specific 'reporter' ion is released. The ratio of signal intensities from these tags acts as an indication of the relative proportions of that peptide between the different labelled samples. This chapter will describe the procedure for labelling and analysing peptide/protein samples using iTRAQ.},

The commonly used methods for assigning peptide sequences to MS/MS spectra are critically discussed and compared, from basic strategies to advanced multi-stage approaches. A particular attention is paid to the problem of false-positive identifications. Existing statistical approaches for assessing the significance of peptide to spectrum matches are surveyed, ranging from single-spectrum approaches such as expectation values to global error rate estimation procedures such as false discovery rates and posterior probabilities. The importance of using auxiliary discriminant information (mass accuracy, peptide separation coordinates, digestion properties, and etc.) is discussed, and advanced computational approaches for joint modeling of multiple sources of information are presented. This review also includes a detailed analysis of the issues affecting the interpretation of data at the protein level, including the amplification of error rates when going from peptide to protein level, and the ambiguities in inferring the identifies of sample proteins in the presence of shared peptides. Commonly used methods for computing protein-level confidence scores are discussed in detail. The review concludes with a discussion of several outstanding computational issues.},

abstract = {A statistical model is presented for computing probabilities that proteins are present in a sample on the basis of peptides assigned to tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra acquired from a proteolytic digest of the sample. Peptides that correspond to more than a single protein in the sequence database are apportioned among all corresponding proteins, and a minimal protein list sufficient to account for the observed peptide assignments is derived using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Using peptide assignments to spectra generated from a sample of 18 purified proteins, as well as complex H. influenzae and Halobacterium samples, the model is shown to produce probabilities that are accurate and have high power to discriminate correct from incorrect protein identifications. This method allows filtering of large-scale proteomics data sets with predictable sensitivity and false positive identification error rates. Fast, consistent, and transparent, it provides a standard for publishing large-scale protein identification data sets in the literature and for comparing the results obtained from different experiments.},

abstract = {To estimate absolute protein contents in complex mixtures, we previously defined a protein abundance index (PAI) as the number of observed peptides divided by the number of observable peptides per protein (Rappsilber, J., Ryder, U., Lamond, A. I., and Mann, M. (2002) Large-scale proteomic analysis of the human spliceosome. Genome. Res. 12, 1231-1245). Here we report that PAI values obtained at different concentrations of serum albumin show a linear relationship with the logarithm of protein concentration in LC-MS/MS experiments. This was also the case for 46 proteins in a mouse whole cell lysate. For absolute quantitation, PAI was converted to exponentially modified PAI (emPAI), equal to 10PAI minus one, which is proportional to protein content in a protein mixture. For the 46 proteins in the whole lysate, the deviation percentages of the emPAI-based abundances from the actual values were within 63{\%} on average, similar or better than determination of abundance by protein staining. emPAI was applied to comprehensive protein expression analysis and to a comparison study between gene and protein expression in a human cancer cell line, HCT116. The values of emPAI are easily calculated and add important quantitation information to proteomic experiments; therefore we suggest that they should be reported in large scale proteomic identification projects.},

abstract = {Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) is a technique for high-sensitivity targeted analysis. In proteomics, MRM-MS can be used to monitor and quantify a peptide based on the production of expected fragment peaks from the selected peptide precursor ion. The choice of which fragment ions to monitor in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in MRM-MS can potentially be guided by existing MS/MS spectra. However, because the majority of discovery experiments are performed on ion trap platforms, there is concern in the field regarding the generalizability of these spectra to MRM-MS on a triple quadrupole instrument. In light of this concern, many operators perform an optimization step to determine the most intense fragments for a target peptide on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. We have addressed this issue by targeting, on a triple quadrupole, the top six y-ion peaks from ion trap-derived consensus library spectra for 258 doubly charged peptides from three different sample sets and quantifying the observed elution curves. This analysis revealed a strong correlation between the y-ion peak rank order and relative intensity across platforms. This suggests that y-type ions obtained from ion trap-based library spectra are well-suited for generating MRM-MS assays for triple quadrupoles and that optimization is not required for each target peptide.},

PeptideProphet is a commonly used computational tool that computes confidence measures for peptide identifications. In this paper, we investigate several limitations of the PeptideProphet modeling approach, including the use of fixed coefficients in computing the discriminant search score and selection of the top scoring peptide assignment per spectrum only. To address these limitations, we describe an adaptive method in which a new discriminant function is learned from the data in an iterative fashion. We extend the modeling framework to go beyond the top scoring peptide assignment per spectrum. We also investigate the effect of clustering the spectra according to their spectrum quality score followed by cluster-specific mixture modeling. The analysis is carried out using data acquired from a mixture of purified proteins on four different types of mass spectrometers, as well as using a complex human serum data set. A special emphasis is placed on the analysis of data generated on high mass accuracy instruments.},

Precise annotation of Chromosome 16 proteins according to C-HPP criteria is presented. Moreover, Human Body Map 2.0 RNA-Seq and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data sets were used to obtain further information relative to cell/tissue specific chromosome 16 coding gene expression patterns and to infer the presence of missing proteins. Twenty-four shotgun 2D-LC-MS/MS and gel/LC-MS/MS MIAPE compliant experiments, representing 41{\%} coverage of chromosome 16 proteins, were performed. Furthermore, mapping of large-scale multicenter mass spectrometry data sets from CCD18, MCF7, Jurkat, and Ramos cell lines into RNA-Seq data allowed further insights relative to correlation of chromosome 16 transcripts and proteins. Detection and quantification of chromosome 16 proteins in biological matrices by SRM procedures are also primary goals of the SpHPP. Two strategies were undertaken: one focused on known proteins, taking advantage of MS data already available, and the second, aimed at the detection of the missing proteins, is based on the expression of recombinant proteins to gather MS information and optimize SRM methods that will be used in real biological samples. SRM methods for 49 known proteins and for recombinant forms of 24 missing proteins are reported in this study.},

abstract = {The shotgun proteomics strategy, based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), has become widely adopted. The identification of peptides from acquired MS/MS spectra is most often performed using the database search approach. We provide a detailed description of the peptide identification process and review the most commonly used database search programs. The appropriate choice of the search parameters and the sequence database are important for successful application of this method, and we provide general guidelines for carrying out efficient analysis of MS/MS data. We also discuss various reasons why database search tools fail to assign the correct sequence to many MS/MS spectra, and draw attention to the problem of false-positive identifications that can significantly diminish the value of published data. To assist in the evaluation of peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, we review the scoring schemes implemented in most frequently used database search tools. We also describe statistical approaches and computational tools for validating peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, including the concept of expectation values, reversed database searching, and the empirical Bayesian analysis of PeptideProphet. Finally, the process of inferring the identities of the sample proteins given the list of peptide identifications is outlined, and the limitations of shotgun proteomics with regard to discrimination between protein isoforms are discussed.},

PeptideProphet is one of the computational tools commonly used for assessing the statistical confidence in peptide assignments to tandem mass spectra obtained using database search programs such as SEQUEST, MASCOT, or X!

We present two flexible methods, the variable component mixture model and the semiparametric mixture model, that remove the restrictive parametric assumptions in the mixture modeling approach of PeptideProphet. Using a control protein mixture data set generated on an linear ion trap Fourier transform (LTQ-FT) mass spectrometer, we demonstrate that both methods improve parametric models in terms of the accuracy of probability estimates and the power to detect correct identifications controlling the false discovery rate to the same degree. The statistical approaches presented here require that the data set contain a sufficient number of decoy (known to be incorrect) peptide identifications, which can be obtained using the target-decoy database search strategy.},

abstract = {Quantitative LC-MS/MS assays were designed for tryptic peptides representing 53 high and medium abundance proteins in human plasma using a multiplexed multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) approach. Of these, 47 produced acceptable quantitative data, demonstrating within-run coefficients of variation (CVs) (n = 10) of 2-22{\%} (78{\%} of assays had CV <10{\%}). A number of peptides gave CVs in the range 2-7{\%} in five experiments (10 replicate runs each) continuously measuring 137 MRMs, demonstrating the precision achievable in complex digests. Depletion of six high abundance proteins by immunosubtraction significantly improved CVs compared with whole plasma, but analytes could be detected in both sample types. Replicate digest and depletion/digest runs yielded correlation coefficients (R(2)) of 0.995 and 0.989, respectively. Absolute analyte specificity for each peptide was demonstrated using MRM-triggered MS/MS scans. Reliable detection of L-selectin (measured at 0.67 microg/ml) indicates that proteins down to the microg/ml level can be quantitated in plasma with minimal sample preparation, yielding a dynamic range of 4.5 orders of magnitude in a single experiment. Peptide MRM measurements in plasma digests thus provide a rapid and specific assay platform for biomarker validation, one that can be extended to lower abundance proteins by enrichment of specific target peptides (stable isotope standards and capture by anti-peptide antibodies (SISCAPA)).},

abstract = {Targeted proteomics based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry is commonly used for accurate and reproducible quantification of protein analytes in complex biological mixtures. Strictly hypothesis-driven, SRM assays quantify each targeted protein by collecting measurements on its peptide fragment ions, called transitions. To achieve sensitive and accurate quantitative results, experimental design and data analysis must consistently account for the variability of the quantified transitions. This consistency is especially important in large experiments, which increasingly require profiling up to hundreds of proteins over hundreds of samples. Here we describe a robust and automated workflow for the analysis of large quantitative SRM data sets that integrates data processing, statistical protein identification and quantification, and dissemination of the results. The integrated workflow combines three software tools: mProphet for peptide identification via probabilistic scoring; SRMstats for protein significance analysis with linear mixed-effect models; and PASSEL, a public repository for storage, retrieval and query of SRM data. The input requirements for the protocol are files with SRM traces in mzXML format, and a file with a list of transitions in a text tab-separated format. The protocol is especially suited for data with heavy isotope-labeled peptide internal standards. We demonstrate the protocol on a clinical data set in which the abundances of 35 biomarker candidates were profiled in 83 blood plasma samples of subjects with ovarian cancer or benign ovarian tumors. The time frame to realize the protocol is 1-2 weeks, depending on the number of replicates used in the experiment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: \textit{Candida albicans} is a ubiquitous opportunistic fungal pathogen that afflicts immunocompromised human hosts. With rare and transient exceptions the yeast is diploid, yet despite its clinical relevance the respective sequences of its two homologous chromosomes have not been completely resolved.

RESULTS: We construct a phased diploid genome assembly by deep sequencing a standard laboratory wild-type strain and a panel of strains homozygous for particular chromosomes. The assembly has 700-fold coverage on average,allowing extensive revision and expansion of the number of known SNPs and indels. This phased genome significantly enhances the sensitivity and specificity of allele-specific expression measurements by enabling pooling and cross-validation of signal across multiple polymorphic sites. Additionally, the diploid assembly reveals pervasive and unexpected patterns in allelic differences between homologous chromosomes. Firstly, we see striking clustering of indels, concentrated primarily in the repeat sequences in promoters. Secondly, both indels and their repeat-sequence substrate are enriched near replication origins. Finally, we reveal an intimate link between repeat sequences and indels, which argues that repeat length is under selective pressure for most eukaryotes. This connection is described by a concise one-parameter model that explains repeat-sequence abundance in C. albicans as a function of the indel rate,and provides a general framework to interpret repeat abundance in species ranging from bacteria to humans.

CONCLUSIONS: The phased genome assembly and insights into repeat plasticity will be valuable for better understanding allele-specific phenomena and genome evolution.},

abstract = {Considering the importance of proteins in the structure and function of the cell wall of \textit{Candida albicans}, we analyzed the cell wall subproteome of this important human pathogen by LC coupled to MS (LC-MS) using different protein extraction procedures. The analyzed samples included material extracted by hydrogen fluoride-pyridine (HF-pyridine), and whole SDS-extracted cell walls. The use of this latter innovative procedure gave similar data as compared to the analysis of HF-pyridine extracted proteins. A total of 21 cell wall proteins predicted to contain a signal peptide were identified, together with a high content of potentially glycosylated Ser/Thr residues, and the presence of a GPI motif in 19 of them. We also identified 66 "atypical" cell wall proteins that lack the above-mentioned characteristics. After tryptic removal of the most accessible proteins in the cell wall, several of the same expected GPI proteins and the most commonly found "atypical" wall proteins were identified. This result suggests that proteins are located not only at the cell wall surface, but are embedded within the cell wall itself. These results, which include new identified cell wall proteins, and comparison of proteins in blastospore and mycelial walls, will help to elucidate the C. albicans cell wall architecture.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry is an important technique for analyzing proteins and other biomolecular compounds in biological samples. Each of the vendors of these mass spectrometers uses a different proprietary binary output file format, which has hindered data sharing and the development of open source software for downstream analysis. The solution has been to develop, with the full participation of academic researchers as well as software and hardware vendors, an open XML-based format for encoding mass spectrometer output files, and then to write software to use this format for archiving, sharing, and processing. This chapter presents the various components and information available for this format, mzML. In addition to the XML schema that defines the file structure, a controlled vocabulary provides clear terms and definitions for the spectral metadata, and a semantic validation rules mapping file allows the mzML semantic validator to insure that an mzML document complies with one of several levels of requirements. Complete documentation and example files insure that the format may be uniformly implemented. At the time of release, there already existed several implementations of the format and vendors have committed to supporting the format in their products.},

abstract = {Two-component signal transduction pathways are one of the primary means by which microorganisms respond to environmental signals. These signaling cascades originated in prokaryotes and were inherited by eukaryotes via endosymbiotic lateral gene transfer from ancestral cyanobacteria. We report here that the nuclear genome of the pathogenic fungus \textit{Candida albicans} contains elements of a two-component signaling pathway that seem to be targeted to the mitochondria. The C. albicans two-component response regulator protein Srr1 (stress response regulator 1) contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N terminus, and fluorescence microscopy reveals mitochondrial localization of green fluorescent protein-tagged Srr1. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicates that C. albicans Srr1 is more closely related to histidine kinases and response regulators found in marine bacteria than are other two-component proteins present in the fungi. These data suggest conservation of this protein during the evolutionary transition from endosymbiont to a subcellular organelle. We used microarray analysis to determine whether the phenotypes observed with a srr1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant could be correlated with gene transcriptional changes. The expression of mitochondrial genes was altered in the srr1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ null mutant in comparison to their expression in the wild type. Furthermore, apoptosis increased significantly in the srr1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant strain compared to the level of apoptosis in the wild type, suggesting the activation of a mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic cell death pathway in the srr1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant. Collectively, this study shows for the first time that a lower eukaryote like C. albicans possesses a two-component response regulator protein that has survived in mitochondria and regulates a subset of genes whose functions are associated with the oxidative stress response and programmed cell death (apoptosis).},

Hyphal wall protein 1 (Hwp1) on germ tubes and true hyphae of \textit{Candida albicans} forms covalent cross-links to buccal epithelial cells in vitro by functioning as a substrate for mammalian transglutaminases. In this study, beige-athymic (bg/bg-nu/nu) or transgenic epsilon 26 mice that have combined natural killer and T cell defects did not succumb to candidiasis after oral administration of C. albicans strains with inactivated HWP1 genes, whereas mice given isogenic strains of C. albicans that had a single copy of HWP1 survived only 2-3 weeks. Illness correlated with extensive alterations of the lingual and esophageal mucosa that were absent in mice given the hwp1/hwp1 mutant. HWP1 is a promising target for development of antifungal drugs for treatment of oroesophageal candidiasis.},

abstract = {The growing use of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry in proteomic analyses led us to investigate how to identify peptides by SRM using only a minimal number of fragment ions. By using a computational model of the SRM work flow we computed the potential interferences from other peptides in a given proteome. From these results, we selected the deterministic SRM addresses that contained sufficient information to confer peptide and protein identity that we termed unique ion signatures (UIS). We computationally showed that UIS comprised of only two transitions are diagnostic for >99{\%} of Escherichia coli proteins and >96{\%} of human proteins that possess a sequence-unique peptide. We demonstrated an example of experimental use of UIS using a modified SRM methodology to profile the E. coli tricarboxylic acid cycle from a single injection of cell lysate. In addition, we showed the potential of UIS to form the first functionally orthogonal approach to validate peptide assignments obtained from conventional analyses of MS/MS spectra. The UIS methodology is a novel deterministic peptide identification method for MS/MS spectra based on information content. These robust theoretical assays will have widespread use when integrated with previously collected MS/MS data and conventional proteomics technologies.},

The method, however, is limited in the number of peptides that can be measured in one run. This number can be markedly increased by scheduling the acquisition if the accurate retention time (RT) of each peptide is known. Here we present iRT, an empirically derived dimensionless peptide-specific value that allows for highly accurate RT prediction. The iRT of a peptide is a fixed number relative to a standard set of reference iRT-peptides that can be transferred across laboratories and chromatographic systems. We show that iRT facilitates the setup of multiplexed experiments with acquisition windows more than four times smaller compared to in silico RT predictions resulting in improved quantification accuracy. iRTs can be determined by any laboratory and shared transparently. The iRT concept has been implemented in Skyline, the most widely used software for MRM experiments.},

abstract = {A protein map of the smallest known self-replicating organism, Mycoplasma genitalium (Class: Mollicutes), revealed a high proportion of acidic proteins. Amino acid composition was used to putatively identify, or provide unique parameters, for 50 gene products separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. A further 19 proteins were subjected to peptide-mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and 4 were subjected to N-terminal Edman degradation. The majority of M. genitalium proteins remain uncharacterised. However, the combined approach of amino acid analysis and peptide-mass fingerprinting allowed gene products to be linked to homologous genes in a variety of organisms. This has allowed proteins to be identified prior to detection of their respective genes via the M. genitalium sequencing initiative. The principle of 'hierarchical' analysis for the mass screening of proteins and the analysis of microbial genomes via their protein complement or 'proteome' is detailed. Here, characterisation of gene products depends upon the quickest and most economical technologies being employed initially, so as to determine if a large number of proteins are already present in both homologous and heterologous species databases. Initial screening, which lends itself to automation and robotics, can then be followed by more time and cost intensive procedures, when necessary.},

abstract = {\textit{Candida albicans} strain SC5314 contains two ALS3 alleles, which differ in sequence with respect to the number of copies of the 108 bp tandem repeat sequence within the central domain of the coding region. One allele (ALS3(12)) has 12 tandem repeat copies while the other (ALS3(9)) has 9 copies. Wild-type C. albicans (ALS3(12)/ALS3(9)) and those containing various ALS3 alleles (ALS3(12)/als3Delta(9), als3Delta(12)/ALS3(9) and als3Delta(12)/als3Delta(9)) were assayed for adhesion to monolayers of cultured vascular endothelial and pharyngeal epithelial cells. These assays showed obvious adhesive function for the larger Als3p protein, compared to a minor contribution to adhesion from the smaller protein. These functional differences in strain SC5314 prompted examination of ALS3 allelic diversity across the five major genetic clades of C. albicans. This analysis focused on the number of copies of the tandem repeat sequence within the central domain of the coding region and showed a range of alleles encoding from 6 to 19 tandem repeat copies. Clades differed with respect to prevalent ALS3 alleles and allele distribution, but were similar for the mean number of tandem repeat copies per ALS3 allele. Analysis of allelic pairing showed clade differences and the tendency for C. albicans strains to encode one longer and one shorter ALS3 allele. The allelic variability observed for ALS3 and its functional consequences observed in strain SC5314 highlight the importance of understanding ALS allelic diversity in order to draw accurate conclusions about Als protein function.},

@article{Quintana2009,
abstract = {The advent of quantitative proteomics opens new opportunities in biomedical and clinical research. Although quantitative proteomics methods based on stable isotope labeling are in general preferred for biomolecular research, biomarker discovery is a case example of a biomedical problem that may be better addressed by using label-free MS techniques. As a proof of concept of this paradigm, we report the use of label-free quantitative LC-MS to profile the urinary peptidome of kidney chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD). The aim was to identify predictive biomarkers that could be used to personalize immunosuppressive therapies for kidney transplant patients. We detected (by LC-M/MS) and quantified (by LC-MS) 6000 polypeptide ions in undigested urine specimens across 39 CAD patients and 32 control individuals. Although unsupervised hierarchical clustering differentiated between the groups when including all the identified peptides, specific peptides derived from uromodulin and kininogen were found to be significantly more abundant in control than in CAD patients and correctly identified the two groups. These peptides are therefore potential biomarkers that might be used for the diagnosis of CAD. In addition, ions at m/z 645.59 and m/z 642.61 were able to differentiate between patients with different forms of CAD with specificities and sensitivities of 90{\%} in a training set and, significantly, of approximately 70{\%} in an independent validation set of samples. Interestingly low expression of uromodulin at m/z 638.03 coupled with high expression of m/z 642.61 diagnosed CAD in virtually all cases. Multiple reaction monitoring experiments further validated the results, illustrating the power of our label-free quantitative LC-MS approach for obtaining quantitative profiles of urinary polypeptides in a rapid, comprehensive, and precise fashion and for biomarker discovery.},

MudPIT was reproducible within 0.5{\%} between two analyses.

@article{Pappin1993,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developments in 'soft' ionisation techniques have revolutionized mass-spectro-metric approaches for the analysis of protein structure. For more than a decade, such techniques have been used, in conjuction with digestion b specific proteases, to produce accurate peptide molecular weight 'fingerprints' of proteins. These fingerprints have commonly been used to screen known proteins, in order to detect errors of translation, to characterize post-translational modifications and to assign diulphide bonds. However, the extent to which peptide-mass information can be used alone to identify unknown sample proteins, independent of other analytical methods such as protein sequence analysis, has remained largely unexplored.

RESULTS: We report here on the development of the molecular weight search (MOWSE) peptide-mass database at the SERC Daresbury Laboratory. Practical experience has shown that sample proteins can be uniquely identified from a few as three or four experimentally determined peptide masses when these are screened against a fragment database that is derived from over 50 000 proteins. Experimental errors of a few Daltons are tolerated by the scoring algorithms, thus permitting the use of inexpensive time-of-flight mass spectrometers. As with other types of physical data, such as amino-acid composition or linear sequence, peptide masses provide a set of determinants that are sufficiently discriminating to identify or match unknown sample proteins.

CONCLUSION: Peptide-mass fingerprints can prove as discriminating as linear peptide sequences, but can be obtained in a fraction of the time using less protein. In many cases, this allows for a rapid identification of a sample protein before committing it to protein sequence analysis. Fragment masses also provide information, at the protein level, that is complementary to the information provided by large-scale DNA sequencing or mapping projects.},

abstract = {\textit{Candida albicans} yeast-to-hypha morphological transition is involved in the virulence strategy of this opportunistic fungal pathogen. Changes in relative abundance of the Candida proteome related to this process were analyzed using different two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based approaches. First, a comparative analysis of yeast and hyphal cytoplasmic proteins allowed the detection of 106 protein spots with significant variation in abundance. Sixty-one of them, corresponding to 46 proteins, were identified. As most of the differentially abundant proteins had an acidic isoelectric point, a large-scale prefractionation approach to analyze the acidic C. albicans subproteome was carried out. Ninety acidic C. albicans proteins were identified by either gel-based or nongel-based approaches. Additionally, different workflows combining preparative isoelectric focusing, Cy labeling, and narrow pH gradient 2-DE gels were tested to analyze the differences in relative protein abundance between yeast and hyphal acidic subproteomes. It was possible to identify 21 differentially abundant acidic proteins; 10 of them were not identified in the previous 2D-DIGE gels. Functional and network interaction analyses of the 56 differentially abundant proteins identified by both approaches rendered an integrated view of metabolic and cellular process reorganization during the yeast-to-hypha transition. With these results, we propose a model of metabolic reorganization.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry is a fundamental tool for discovery and analysis in the life sciences. With the rapid advances in mass spectrometry technology and methods, it has become imperative to provide a standard output format for mass spectrometry data that will facilitate data sharing and analysis. Initially, the efforts to develop a standard format for mass spectrometry data resulted in multiple formats, each designed with a different underlying philosophy. To resolve the issues associated with having multiple formats, vendors, researchers, and software developers convened under the banner of the HUPO PSI to develop a single standard. The new data format incorporated many of the desirable technical attributes from the previous data formats, while adding a number of improvements, including features such as a controlled vocabulary with validation tools to ensure consistent usage of the format, improved support for selected reaction monitoring data, and immediately available implementations to facilitate rapid adoption by the community. The resulting standard data format, mzML, is a well tested open-source format for mass spectrometer output files that can be readily utilized by the community and easily adapted for incremental advances in mass spectrometry technology.},

When a new standard format is produced, it is important that software tools are available that make it straightforward for laboratory scientists to use it routinely and for bioinformaticians to embed support in their own tools. Here we report the release of several open-source Java-based software packages based on mzIdentML: ProteoIDViewer, mzidLibrary, and mzidValidator. The ProteoIDViewer is a desktop application allowing users to visualize mzIdentML-formatted results originating from any appropriate identification software; it supports visualization of all the features of the mzIdentML format. The mzidLibrary is a software library containing routines for importing data from external search engines, post-processing identification data (such as false discovery rate calculations), combining results from multiple search engines, performing protein inference, setting identification thresholds, and exporting results from mzIdentML to plain text files. The mzidValidator is able to process files and report warnings or errors if files are not correctly formatted or contain some semantic error. We anticipate that these developments will simplify adoption of the new standard in proteomics laboratories and the integration of mzIdentML into other software tools. All three tools are freely available in the public domain.},

abstract = {Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) quantitation of proteins can dramatically impact the discovery and quantitation of biomarkers via rapid, targeted, multiplexed protein expression profiling of clinical samples. A mixture of 45 peptide standards, easily adaptable to common plasma proteomics work flows, was created to permit absolute quantitation of 45 endogenous proteins in human plasma trypsin digests. All experiments were performed on simple tryptic digests of human EDTA-plasma without prior affinity depletion or enrichment. Stable isotope-labeled standard peptides were added immediately following tryptic digestion because addition of stable isotope-labeled standard peptides prior to trypsin digestion was found to generate elevated and unpredictable results. Proteotypic tryptic peptides containing isotopically coded amino acids ([(13)C(6)]Arg or [(13)C(6)]Lys) were synthesized for all 45 proteins. Peptide purity was assessed by capillary zone electrophoresis, and the peptide quantity was determined by amino acid analysis. For maximum sensitivity and specificity, instrumental parameters were empirically determined to generate the most abundant precursor ions and y ion fragments. Concentrations of individual peptide standards in the mixture were optimized to approximate endogenous concentrations of analytes and to ensure the maximum linear dynamic range of the MRM assays. Excellent linear responses (r > 0.99) were obtained for 43 of the 45 proteins with attomole level limits of quantitation (<20{\%} coefficient of variation) for 27 of the 45 proteins. Analytical precision for 44 of the 45 assays varied by <10{\%}. LC-MRM/MS analyses performed on 3 different days on different batches of plasma trypsin digests resulted in coefficients of variation of <20{\%} for 42 of the 45 assays. Concentrations for 39 of the 45 proteins are within a factor of 2 of reported literature values. This mixture of internal standards has many uses and can be applied to the characterization of trypsin digestion kinetics and plasma protein expression profiling because 31 of the 45 proteins are putative biomarkers of cardiovascular disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The growing interest in the field of proteomics has increased the demand for software tools and applications that process and analyze the resulting data. And even though the purpose of these tools can vary significantly, they usually share a basic set of features, including the handling of protein and peptide sequences, the visualization of (and interaction with) spectra and chromatograms, and the parsing of results from various proteomics search engines. Developers typically spend considerable time and effort implementing these support structures, which detracts from working on the novel aspects of their tool.

RESULTS: In order to simplify the development of proteomics tools, we have implemented an open-source support library for computational proteomics, called compomics-utilities. The library contains a broad set of features required for reading, parsing, and analyzing proteomics data. compomics-utilities is already used by a long list of existing software, ensuring library stability and continued support and development.

CONCLUSIONS: As a user-friendly, well-documented and open-source library, compomics-utilities greatly simplifies the implementation of the basic features needed in most proteomics tools. Implemented in 100{\%} Java, compomics-utilities is fully portable across platforms and architectures. Our library thus allows the developers to focus on the novel aspects of their tools, rather than on the basic functions, which can contribute substantially to faster development, and better tools for proteomics.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a small molecule with distinct roles in diverse physiological functions in biological systems, among them the control of the apoptotic signalling cascade. By combining proteomic, genetic and biochemical approaches we demonstrate that NO and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are crucial mediators of yeast apoptosis. Using indirect methodologies and a NO-selective electrode, we present results showing that H2O2-induced apoptotic cells synthesize NO that is associated to a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like activity as demonstrated by the use of a classical NOS kit assay. Additionally, our results show that yeast GAPDH is a target of extensive proteolysis upon H2O2-induced apoptosis and undergoes S-nitrosation. Blockage of NO synthesis with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester leads to a decrease of GAPDH S-nitrosation and of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, increasing survival. These results indicate that NO signalling and GAPDH S-nitrosation are linked with H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death. Evidence is presented showing that NO and GAPDH S-nitrosation also mediate cell death during chronological life span pointing to a physiological role of NO in yeast apoptosis.},

We have constructed a PeptideAtlas (PA) covering 62.7{\%} of the predicted proteome of the extremely halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 by compiling approximately 636 000 tandem mass spectra from 497 mass spectrometry runs in 88 experiments. Analysis of the PA with respect to biophysical properties of constituent peptides, functional properties of parent proteins of detected peptides, and performance of different mass spectrometry approaches has highlighted plausible strategies for improving proteome coverage and selecting signature peptides for targeted proteomics. Notably, discovery of a significant correlation between absolute abundances of mRNAs and proteins has helped identify low abundance of proteins as the major limitation in peptide detection. Furthermore, we have discovered that iTRAQ labeling for quantitative proteomic analysis introduces a significant bias in peptide detection by mass spectrometry. Therefore, despite identifying at least one proteotypic peptide for almost all proteins in the PA, a context-dependent selection of proteotypic peptides appears to be the most effective approach for targeted proteomics.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry has grown in recent years to a well-accepted and increasingly important complementary technique in structural biology. Especially electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is well suited for the detection of non-covalent protein complexes and their interactions with DNA, RNA, ligands, and cofactors. Over the last decade, significant advances have been made in the ionization and mass analysis techniques, which makes the investigation of even larger and more heterogeneous intact assemblies feasible. These technological developments have paved the way to study intact non-covalent protein-protein interactions, assembly and disassembly in real time, subunit exchange, cooperativity effects, and effects of cofactors, allowing us a better understanding of proteins in cellular processes. In this review, we describe some of the latest developments and several highlights.},

abstract = {\textit{Candida albicans} is the most common cause of hematogenously disseminated and oropharyngeal candidiasis. Both of these diseases are characterized by fungal invasion of host cells. Previously, we have found that C. albicans hyphae invade endothelial cells and oral epithelial cells in vitro by inducing their own endocytosis. Therefore, we set out to identify the fungal surface protein and host cell receptors that mediate this process. We found that the C. albicans Als3 is required for the organism to be endocytosed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells and two different human oral epithelial lines. Affinity purification experiments with wild-type and an als3delta/als3delta mutant strain of C. albicans demonstrated that Als3 was required for C. albicans to bind to multiple host cell surface proteins, including N-cadherin on endothelial cells and E-cadherin on oral epithelial cells. Furthermore, latex beads coated with the recombinant N-terminal portion of Als3 were endocytosed by Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human N-cadherin or E-cadherin, whereas control beads coated with bovine serum albumin were not. Molecular modeling of the interactions of the N-terminal region of Als3 with the ectodomains of N-cadherin and E-cadherin indicated that the binding parameters of Als3 to either cadherin are similar to those of cadherin-cadherin binding. Therefore, Als3 is a fungal invasin that mimics host cell cadherins and induces endocytosis by binding to N-cadherin on endothelial cells and E-cadherin on oral epithelial cells. These results uncover the first known fungal invasin and provide evidence that C. albicans Als3 is a molecular mimic of human cadherins.},

abstract = {Post-translational modifications are highly dynamic and known to regulate many cellular processes. Both the site and the stoichiometry of modification of a given protein sequence can have profound effects on the regulation of protein function. Thus, the identification of sites of post-translational modification is crucial for fully deciphering the biological roles of any given protein. The acute regulation and typically low stoichiometry of many post-translational modifications makes characterization of the sites of modification challenging. Thus, the development of analytical strategies to aid the selective enrichment and characterization of these species is paramount. Ongoing developments in mass spectrometry resulting in increased speed and sensitivity of analysis mean that mass spectrometry has become the ideal analytical tool for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of protein modifications. This chapter provides an overview of the most popular LC-MS/MS-based strategies for the enrichment of modified peptides/proteins and mass spectrometric workflows targeted toward the analysis of specific post-translationally modified analytes.},

abstract = {A general method for the quantification of proteins in human serum was developed using mass spectrometry (MS) and stable isotope-labeled synthetic peptides as internal standards. Using this approach, C-reactive protein (CRP), a diagnostic marker of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), was detected in serum samples taken from patients with either erosive or nonerosive RA and compared to healthy individuals. Small volumes of serum samples were enriched for low-abundance proteins through the selective removal of human serum albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and haptoglobin. After depletion of abundant proteins, the complexity of the protein mixture was further simplified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to fractionate denatured proteins into discrete molecular weight ranges. Fractions of interest containing CRP, M(r) = 25 000, were pooled, digested with trypsin, and then fixed quantities of the synthetic peptides were added to the mixture. The mixture of tryptic peptides was subsequently analyzed by nanoflow chromatography-tandem MS (nanoLC-MS/MS) using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQ-MS). The ratio of transition ions derived from the endogenous and isotope-labeled peptides provided a quantitative measure of CRP in the original samples as assessed by independent measurement of CRP in the same patient samples using an immunoassay. The use of isotope-labeled synthetic peptides and MRM is a powerful analytical method for the prescreening of candidate protein biomarkers in human serum prior to antibody and immunoassay development.},

abstract = {In an effort to bring novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or even potential targets for vaccine design for systemic candidiasis (SC) into the open, a systematic proteomic approach coupled with bioinformatic analysis was used to decode the serological response to Candida wall immunome in SC patients. Serum levels of IgG antibodies against Candida wall-associated proteins (proteins secreted from protoplasts in active wall regeneration, separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and identified by mass spectrometry) were measured in 45 SC patients, 57 non-SC patients, and 61 healthy subjects by Western blotting. Two-way hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis of their serum anti-Candida wall antibody expression patterns discriminated SC patients from controls and highlighted the heterogeneity of their expression profiles. Multivariate logistic regression models demonstrated that high levels of antibodies against glucan 1,3-beta-glucosidase (Bgl2p) and the anti-wall phosphoglycerate kinase antibody seropositivity were the only independent predictors of SC. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed no difference between their combined evaluation and measurement of anti-Bgl2p antibodies alone. In a logistic regression model adjusted for known prognostic factors for mortality, SC patients with high anti-Bgl2p antibody levels or a positive anti-wall enolase antibody status, which correlated with each other, had a reduced 2-month risk of death. After controlling for each other, only the seropositivity for anti-wall enolase antibodies was an independent predictor of a lower risk of fatality, supporting that these mediated the protective effect. No association between serum anti-cytoplasmic enolase antibody levels and outcomes was established, suggesting a specific mechanism of enolase processing during wall biogenesis. We conclude that serum anti-Bgl2p antibodies are a novel accurate diagnostic biomarker for SC and that, at high levels, they may provide protection by modulating the anti-wall enolase antibody response. Furthermore serum anti-wall enolase antibodies are a new prognostic indicator for SC and confer protection against it. Bgl2p and wall-associated enolase could be valuable candidates for future vaccine development.},

However, orthologs of classical mammalian apoptosis regulators appeared to be missing from the yeast genome, challenging a common mechanism of yeast and mammalian apoptosis. Here we investigate Yor197w, a yeast protein with structural homology to mammalian caspases, and demonstrate caspase-like processing of the protein. Hydrogen peroxide treatment induces apoptosis together with a caspase-like enzymatic activity in yeast. This response is completely abrogated after disruption and strongly stimulated after overexpression of Yor197w. Yor197w also mediates the death process within chronologically aged cultures, pointing to a physiological role in elimination of overaged cells. We conclude that Yor197w indeed functions as a bona fide caspase in yeast and propose the name Yeast Caspase-1 (YCA1, gene YCA1).},

This chapter describes detailed procedures for the analysis of urinary polypeptides by LC-MS/MS. Hundreds to thousands of small peptides (∼700 to ∼7000 Da) can be detected in urine with the described techniques. Extraction procedures, based on commercially available reagents, effectively remove interfering urinary organic and inorganic salts and neutral compounds, making this a robust and simple assay with the power to detect hundreds to thousands of polypeptides in urine. Analysis time is relatively short, making this protocol a valuable alternative to conventional proteomic techniques based on multidimensional separations. The methodology is therefore particularly useful when the aim is to analyse samples with sufficient depth and throughput so as to make it useful to compare large numbers of specimens. Procedures for enhancing quantitative and qualitative analysis of LC-MS/MS data are also detailed.},

With the first results of the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project being analyzed and many other large-scale proteomics projects about to disseminate their data, this trend is not likely to flatten out any time soon. However, the publication mechanism of these identified proteins has lagged behind in technical terms. Often very long lists of identifications are either published directly with the article, resulting in both a voluminous and rather tedious read, or are included on the publisher's website as supplementary information. In either case, these lists are typically only provided as portable document format documents with a custom-made layout, making it practically impossible for computer programs to interpret them, let alone efficiently query them. Here we propose the proteomics identifications (PRIDE) database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride) as a means to finally turn publicly available data into publicly accessible data.

Proteomics methods based on mass spectrometry hold special promise for the discovery of novel biomarkers that might form the foundation for new clinical blood tests, but to date their contribution to the diagnostic armamentarium has been disappointing. This is due in part to the lack of a coherent pipeline connecting marker discovery with well-established methods for validation. Advances in methods and technology now enable construction of a comprehensive biomarker pipeline from six essential process components: candidate discovery, qualification, verification, research assay optimization, biomarker validation and commercialization. Better understanding of the overall process of biomarker discovery and validation and of the challenges and strategies inherent in each phase should improve experimental study design, in turn increasing the efficiency of biomarker development and facilitating the delivery and deployment of novel clinical tests.},

abstract = {New antifungal agents are urgently required to combat life-threatening infections caused by opportunistic fungal pathogens like \textit{Candida albicans}. The manipulation of endogenous fungal programmed cell death responses could provide a basis for future therapies. Here we assess the physiology of death in C. albicans in response to environmental stresses (acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide) and an antifungal agent (amphotericin B). Exposure of C. albicans to 40-60 mM acetic acid, 5-10 mM hydrogen peroxide, or 4-8 microg.ml-1 amphotericin B produced cellular changes reminiscent of mammalian apoptosis. Nonviable cells that excluded propidium iodide displayed the apoptotic marker phosphatidylserine (as shown by annexin-V-FITC labeling), were terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive (indicating nuclease-mediated double-strand DNA breakage), and produced reactive oxygen species. Ultrastructural changes in apoptotic cells included chromatin condensation and margination, separation of the nuclear envelope, and nuclear fragmentation. C. albicans cells treated at higher doses of these compounds showed cellular changes characteristic of necrosis. Necrotic cells displayed reduced TUNEL staining, a lack of surface phosphatidylserine, limited reactive oxygen species production, and an inability to exclude propidium iodide. Necrotic cells lacked defined nuclei and showed extensive intracellular vacuolization. Apoptosis in C. albicans was associated with an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and under some apoptosis-inducing conditions, significant proportions of yeast cells switched to hyphal growth before dying. This is a demonstration of apoptosis in a medically important fungal pathogen.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) are families of proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences, or TF response elements (TFREs), and function as regulators of many cellular processes. Because of the low abundance of TFs, direct quantitative measurement of TFs on a proteome scale remains a challenge. In this study, we report the development of an affinity reagent that permits identification of endogenous TFs at the proteome scale. The affinity reagent is composed of a synthetic DNA containing a concatenated tandem array of the consensus TFREs (catTFRE) for the majority of TF families. By using catTFRE to enrich TFs from cells, we were able to identify as many as 400 TFs from a single cell line and a total of 878 TFs from 11 cell types, covering more than 50{\%} of the gene products that code for the DNA-binding TFs in the genome. We further demonstrated that catTFRE pull-downs could quantitatively measure proteome-wide changes in DNA binding activity of TFs in response to exogenous stimulation by using a label-free MS-based quantification approach. Applying catTFRE on the evaluation of drug effects, we described a panoramic view of TF activations and provided candidates for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of drug actions. We anticipate that the catTFRE affinity strategy will find widespread applications in biomedical research.},

@article{Navarro2009a,
abstract = {Using decoy databases to estimate the number of false positive assignations is one of the most widely used methods to calculate false discovery rates in large-scale peptide identification studies. However, in spite of their widespread use, the decoy approach has not been fully standardized. In conjunction with target databases, decoy databases may be used separately or in the form of concatenated databases, allowing a competition strategy; depending on the method used, two alternative formulations are possible to calculate error rates. Although both methods are conservative, the separate database approach overestimates the number of false positive assignations due to the presence of MS/MS spectra produced by true peptides, while the concatenated approach calculates the error rate in a population that has a higher size than that obtained after searching a target database. In this work, we demonstrate that by analyzing as a whole the joint distribution of matches obtained after performing a separate database search, and applying the competition strategy, it is possible to make a more accurate calculation of false discovery rates. We show that both separate and concatenated approaches clearly overestimate error rates with respect to those calculated by the new algorithm, using several kinds of scores. We conclude that the new indicator provides a more sensitive alternative, and establishes for the first time a unique and integrated framework to calculate error rates in large-scale peptide identification studies.},
