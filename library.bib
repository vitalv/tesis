abstract = {Human blood plasma can be obtained relatively noninvasively and contains proteins from most, if not all, tissues of the body. Therefore, an extensive, quantitative catalog of plasma proteins is an important starting point for the discovery of disease biomarkers. In 2005, we showed that different proteomics measurements using different sample preparation and analysis techniques identify significantly different sets of proteins, and that a comprehensive plasma proteome can be compiled only by combining data from many different experiments. Applying advanced computational methods developed for the analysis and integration of very large and diverse data sets generated by tandem MS measurements of tryptic peptides, we have now compiled a high-confidence human plasma proteome reference set with well over twice the identified proteins of previous high-confidence sets. It includes a hierarchy of protein identifications at different levels of redundancy following a clearly defined scheme, which we propose as a standard that can be applied to any proteomics data set to facilitate cross-proteome analyses. Further, to aid in development of blood-based diagnostics using techniques such as selected reaction monitoring, we provide a rough estimate of protein concentrations using spectral counting. We identified 20,433 distinct peptides, from which we inferred a highly nonredundant set of 1929 protein sequences at a false discovery rate of 1\%. We have made this resource available via PeptideAtlas, a large, multiorganism, publicly accessible compendium of peptides identified in tandem MS experiments conducted by laboratories around the world.},

abstract = {Data processing, management and visualization are central and critical components of a state of the art high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics experiment, and are often some of the most time-consuming steps, especially for labs without much bioinformatics support. The growing interest in the field of proteomics has triggered an increase in the development of new software libraries, including freely available and open-source software. From database search analysis to post-processing of the identification results, even though the objectives of these libraries and packages can vary significantly, they usually share a number of features. Common use cases include the handling of protein and peptide sequences, the parsing of results from various proteomics search engines output files, and the visualization of MS-related information (including mass spectra and chromatograms). In this review, we provide an overview of the existing software libraries, open-source frameworks and also, we give information on some of the freely available applications which make use of them.

This web-based application integrates different sources of information to finding groups of genes with similar biological meaning. This process, known as enrichment analysis, is essential in the interpretation of high-throughput experiments. The frequent feedbacks and the natural evolution of genomics and bioinformatics have allowed the growth of the tool and the development of this third release. In this version, a special effort has been made to remove noisy and redundant output from the enrichment results with the inclusion of a recently reported algorithm that summarizes significantly enriched terms and generates functionally coherent modules of genes and terms. A new comparative analysis has been added to allow the differential analysis of gene sets. To expand the scope of the application, new sources of biological information have been included, such as genetic diseases, drugs-genes interactions and Pubmed information among others. Finally, the graphic section has been renewed with the inclusion of new interactive graphics and filtering options. The application is freely available at http://genecodis.cnb.csic.es.},

abstract = {In proteomics, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is rapidly gaining importance for targeted protein quantification. The triple quadrupole mass analyzers used in SRM assays allow for levels of specificity and sensitivity hard to accomplish by more standard shotgun proteomics experiments. Often, an SRM assay is built by in silico prediction of transitions and/or extraction of peptide precursor and fragment ions from a spectral library. Spectral libraries are typically generated from nonideal ion trap based shotgun proteomics experiments or synthetic peptide libraries, consuming considerable time and effort. Here, we investigate the usability of beam type CID (or "higher energy CID" (HCD)) peptide fragmentation spectra, as acquired using an Orbitrap Velos, to facilitate SRM assay development. Therefore, peptide fragmentation spectra, obtained by ion-trap CID, triple-quadrupole CID (QqQ-CID) and Orbitrap HCD, originating from digested cellular lysates, were compared. Spectral comparison and a dedicated correlation algorithm indicated significantly higher similarity between QqQ-CID and HCD fragmentation spectra than between QqQ-CID and ion trap-CID spectra. SRM transitions generated using a constructed HCD spectral library increased SRM assay sensitivity up to 2-fold, when compared to the use of a library created from more conventionally used ion trap-CID spectra, showing that HCD spectra can assist SRM assay development.},

abstract = {Yeast has been a valuable model to study replicative and chronological ageing processes. Replicative ageing is defined by the number of daughter cells a mother can give birth to and hence reflects the ageing situation in proliferating cells, whereas chronological ageing is widely accepted as a model for postmitotic tissue ageing. Since both ageing forms end in yeast programmed death (necrotic and apoptotic), and abrogation of cell death by deletion of the apoptotic machinery or diminishment of oxidative radicals leads to longevity, apoptosis and ageing seem closely connected. This review focuses on ageing as a physiological way to induce yeast apoptosis, which unexpectedly defines apoptosis as a pro- and not an anti-ageing mechanism.},

@article{Abbatiello2010a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) of peptides with stable isotope-labeled internal standards (SISs) is increasingly being used to develop quantitative assays for proteins in complex biological matrices. These assays can be highly precise and quantitative, but the frequent occurrence of interferences requires that MRM-MS data be manually reviewed, a time-intensive process subject to human error. We developed an algorithm that identifies inaccurate transition data based on the presence of interfering signal or inconsistent recovery among replicate samples.

METHODS: The algorithm objectively evaluates MRM-MS data with 2 orthogonal approaches. First, it compares the relative product ion intensities of the analyte peptide to those of the SIS peptide and uses a t-test to determine if they are significantly different. A CV is then calculated from the ratio of the analyte peak area to the SIS peak area from the sample replicates.

RESULTS: The algorithm identified problematic transitions and achieved accuracies of 94\%-100\%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 83\%-100\% for correct identification of errant transitions. The algorithm was robust when challenged with multiple types of interferences and problematic transitions.

CONCLUSIONS: This algorithm for automated detection of inaccurate and imprecise transitions (AuDIT) in MRM-MS data reduces the time required for manual and subjective inspection of data, improves the overall accuracy of data analysis, and is easily implemented into the standard data-analysis work flow. AuDIT currently works with results exported from MRM-MS data-processing software packages and may be implemented as an analysis tool within such software.},

abstract = {The opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans causes a wide variety of infections including deep systemic syndromes. The C. albicans plasma membrane is an important interface in the host-pathogen relationship. The plasma membrane proteins mediate a variety of functions, including sensing and signalling to the external environment, in which the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins play a crucial role. A subproteomic approach to obtain a global picture of the protein composition of the C. albicans plasma membrane was developed, and different strategies were tested in order to extract the largest number of yeast plasma membrane proteins and GPI-anchored membrane proteins. These methods involved: (i) protoplast generation, (ii) mechanical disruption, (iii) ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, and (iv) Na(2)CO(3) treatments. To isolate GPI-anchored proteins two additional steps were performed: two-phase separation and phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment. After LC-MS/MS analysis using both a MALDI-TOF/TOF and a linear ion trap quadrupole, a total of 214 membrane proteins were identified, including 41 already described as plasma membrane proteins, 20 plasma membrane associated proteins, and 22 proteins with unknown membrane localisation. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that this set of C. albicans membrane proteins is highly enriched in proteins involved in biopolymer biosynthesis or transport processes. Furthermore, after phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C treatment, 12 GPI-anchored membrane proteins were released and identified; most of them are associated with cell wall beta-glucan synthesis and maintenance or are virulence factors, such as phospholipases or aspartyl proteinases.},

abstract = {Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a technique for quantifying specific proteins using triple quadrupole MS. Proteins are digested into peptides and fed into MS following HPLC separation. The stream of ionized peptides is filtered by m/z ratio so only specific peptide targets enter the collision cell, where they are fragmented into product ions. A specific product ion is then filtered from the cell and its intensity measured. By spiking an isotopically labeled version of each target peptide into a sample, both native and surrogate peptides enter MS, pass the filters and transition into product ions in tandem; thus the quantity of the native peptide may be calculated by examining the relative intensities of the native and surrogate signals. The choice of precursor-to-product ion transitions is critical for SRM, but predicting the best candidates is challenging and time-consuming. To alleviate this problem, software tools for designing and optimizing transitions have recently emerged, predominantly driven by data from public proteomics repositories, such as the Global Proteome Machine and PeptideAtlas. In this review, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in automated SRM transition design tools in the public domain, explaining how the systems work and how to use them.},

abstract = {High throughput identification of peptides in databases from tandem mass spectrometry data is a key technique in modern proteomics. Common approaches to interpret large scale peptide identification results are based on the statistical analysis of average score distributions, which are constructed from the set of best scores produced by large collections of MS/MS spectra by using searching engines such as SEQUEST. Other approaches calculate individual peptide identification probabilities on the basis of theoretical models or from single-spectrum score distributions constructed by the set of scores produced by each MS/MS spectrum. In this work, we study the mathematical properties of average SEQUEST score distributions by introducing the concept of spectrum quality and expressing these average distributions as compositions of single-spectrum distributions. We predict and demonstrate in the practice that average score distributions are dominated by the quality distribution in the spectra collection, except in the low probability region, where it is possible to predict the dependence of average probability on database size. Our analysis leads to a novel indicator, the probability ratio, which takes optimally into account the statistical information provided by the first and second best scores. The probability ratio is a non-parametric and robust indicator that makes spectra classification according to parameters such as charge state unnecessary and allows a peptide identification performance, on the basis of false discovery rates, that is better than that obtained by other empirical statistical approaches. The probability ratio also compares favorably with statistical probability indicators obtained by the construction of single-spectrum SEQUEST score distributions. These results make the robustness, conceptual simplicity, and ease of automation of the probability ratio algorithm a very attractive alternative to determine peptide identification confidences and error rates in high throughput experiments.},

In this method the protein database is searched to identify linear amino acid sequences within a mass tolerance of ±1 u of the precursor ion molecular weight A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted from amino acid sequences obtained from the database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions of the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Searches of species-specific protein databases with tandem mass spectra acquired from peptides obtained from the enzymatically digested total proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells allowed matching of the spectra to amino acid sequences within proteins of these organisms. The approach described in this manuscript provides a convenient method to interpret tandem mass spectra with known sequences in a protein database.},

abstract = {The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans switches from a budding yeast form to a polarized hyphal form in response to various external signals. This morphogenetic switching has been implicated in the development of pathogenicity. We have cloned the CaCDC35 gene encoding C. albicans adenylyl cyclase by functional complementation of the conditional growth defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with mutations in Ras1p and Ras2p. It has previously been shown that these Ras homologues regulate adenylyl cyclase in yeast. The C. albicans adenylyl cyclase is highly homologous to other fungal adenylyl cyclases but has less sequence similarity with the mammalian enzymes. C. albicans cells deleted for both alleles of CaCDC35 had no detectable cAMP levels, suggesting that this gene encodes the only adenylyl cyclase in C. albicans. The homozygous mutant cells were viable but grew more slowly than wild-type cells and were unable to switch from the yeast to the hyphal form under all environmental conditions that we analyzed in vitro. Moreover, this morphogenetic switch was completely blocked in mutant cells undergoing phagocytosis by macrophages. However, morphogenetic switching was restored by exogenous cAMP. On the basis of epistasis experiments, we propose that CaCdc35p acts downstream of the Ras homologue CaRas1p. These epistasis experiments also suggest that the putative transcription factor Efg1p and components of the hyphal-inducing MAP kinase pathway depend on the function of CaCdc35p in their ability to induce morphogenetic switching. Homozygous cacdc35 Delta cells were unable to establish vaginal infection in a mucosal membrane mouse model and were avirulent in a mouse model for systemic infections. These findings suggest that fungal adenylyl cyclases and other regulators of the cAMP signaling pathway may be useful targets for antifungal drugs.},

abstract = {Numerous studies highlight the importance of macrophages for optimal host protection against systemic Candida albicans infections. We chose the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and the wild-type strain C. albicans SC5314 to study of the induced expression/repression of proteins in macrophages when they are in contact with C. albicans, based on 2-DE, comparison between different gels and protein identification. RAW 264.7 cells were allowed to interact with C. albicans cells for 45 min, and a significant differential protein expression was observed in these macrophages compared to controls. Gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby, allowing a better quantification of the intensity of the protein spots. Fifteen spots were up-regulated, whereas 32 were down-regulated; 60 spots appeared and 49 disappeared. Among them, we identified 11 proteins: annexin I, LyGDI (GDID4), Hspa5 (Grp78, Bip), tropomyosin 5 and L-plastin, that augment; and Eif3s5, Hsp60, Hspa9a, Grp58 (ER75), and Hspa8a (Hsc70), that decrease. The translation elongation factor (Eef2p) is modified in some of its different protein species. Many processes seem to be affected: cytoskeletal organisation, oxidative responses (superoxide and nitric oxide production) and protein biosynthesis and refolding.},

abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) is a small molecule with distinct roles in diverse physiological functions in biological systems, among them the control of the apoptotic signalling cascade. By combining proteomic, genetic and biochemical approaches we demonstrate that NO and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are crucial mediators of yeast apoptosis. Using indirect methodologies and a NO-selective electrode, we present results showing that H2O2-induced apoptotic cells synthesize NO that is associated to a nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like activity as demonstrated by the use of a classical NOS kit assay. Additionally, our results show that yeast GAPDH is a target of extensive proteolysis upon H2O2-induced apoptosis and undergoes S-nitrosation. Blockage of NO synthesis with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester leads to a decrease of GAPDH S-nitrosation and of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, increasing survival. These results indicate that NO signalling and GAPDH S-nitrosation are linked with H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death. Evidence is presented showing that NO and GAPDH S-nitrosation also mediate cell death during chronological life span pointing to a physiological role of NO in yeast apoptosis.},

abstract = {Candida spp. are medically important fungi causing severe mucosal and life-threatening invasive infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts. However, not all individuals at risk develop Candida infections, and it is believed that genetic variation plays an important role in host susceptibility. On the one hand, severe fungal infections are associated with monogenic primary immunodeficiencies such as defects in STAT1, STAT3 or CARD9, recently discovered as novel clinical entities. On the other hand, more common polymorphisms in genes of the immune system have also been associated with fungal infections such as recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and candidemia. The discovery of the genetic susceptibility to Candida infections can lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, as well as to the design of novel immunotherapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {In many studies, particularly in the field of systems biology, it is essential that identical protein sets are precisely quantified in multiple samples such as those representing differentially perturbed cell states. The high degree of reproducibility required for such experiments has not been achieved by classical mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods. In this study we describe the implementation of a targeted quantitative approach by which predetermined protein sets are first identified and subsequently quantified at high sensitivity reliably in multiple samples. This approach consists of three steps. First, the proteome is extensively mapped out by multidimensional fractionation and tandem mass spectrometry, and the data generated are assembled in the PeptideAtlas database. Second, based on this proteome map, peptides uniquely identifying the proteins of interest, proteotypic peptides, are selected, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions are established and validated by MS2 spectrum acquisition. This process of peptide selection, transition selection, and validation is supported by a suite of software tools, TIQAM (Targeted Identification for Quantitative Analysis by MRM), described in this study. Third, the selected target protein set is quantified in multiple samples by MRM. Applying this approach we were able to reliably quantify low abundance virulence factors from cultures of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes exposed to increasing amounts of plasma. The resulting quantitative protein patterns enabled us to clearly define the subset of virulence proteins that is regulated upon plasma exposure.},

abstract = {Motivation: Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) identifies protein sequences using database search engines, at the core of which is a score that measures the similarity between peptide MS/MS spectra and a protein sequence database. The TANDEM application was developed as a freely available database search engine for the proteomics research community. To extend TANDEM as a platform for further research on developing improved database scoring methods, we modified the software to allow users to redefine the scoring function and replace the native TANDEM scoring function while leaving the remaining core application intact. Redefinition is performed at run time so multiple scoring functions are available to be selected and applied from a single search engine binary. We introduce the implementation of the pluggable scoring algorithm and also provide implementations of two TANDEM compatible scoring functions, one previously described scoring function compatible with PeptideProphet and one very simple scoring function that quantitative researchers may use to begin their development. This extension builds on the open-source TANDEM project and will facilitate research into and dissemination of novel algorithms for matching MS/MS spectra to peptide sequences. The pluggable scoring schema is also compatible with related search applications P3 and Hunter, which are part of the X! suite of database matching algorithms. The pluggable scores and the X! suite of applications are all written in C++. Contact:mmcintosh@fhcrc.org Availability: Source code for the scoring functions is available from http://proteomics.fhcrc.org Supplementary information:http://proteomics.fhcrc.org},

Proteomics methods based on mass spectrometry hold special promise for the discovery of novel biomarkers that might form the foundation for new clinical blood tests, but to date their contribution to the diagnostic armamentarium has been disappointing. This is due in part to the lack of a coherent pipeline connecting marker discovery with well-established methods for validation. Advances in methods and technology now enable construction of a comprehensive biomarker pipeline from six essential process components: candidate discovery, qualification, verification, research assay optimization, biomarker validation and commercialization. Better understanding of the overall process of biomarker discovery and validation and of the challenges and strategies inherent in each phase should improve experimental study design, in turn increasing the efficiency of biomarker development and facilitating the delivery and deployment of novel clinical tests.},

In addition, physiological occurrence of cell death has been detected during aging and mating in yeast. The finding of apoptosis in yeast, other fungi and parasites is not only of great medical relevance but will also help to understand some of the still unknown molecular mechanisms at the core of apoptotic execution.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) are families of proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences, or TF response elements (TFREs), and function as regulators of many cellular processes. Because of the low abundance of TFs, direct quantitative measurement of TFs on a proteome scale remains a challenge. In this study, we report the development of an affinity reagent that permits identification of endogenous TFs at the proteome scale. The affinity reagent is composed of a synthetic DNA containing a concatenated tandem array of the consensus TFREs (catTFRE) for the majority of TF families. By using catTFRE to enrich TFs from cells, we were able to identify as many as 400 TFs from a single cell line and a total of 878 TFs from 11 cell types, covering more than 50\% of the gene products that code for the DNA-binding TFs in the genome. We further demonstrated that catTFRE pull-downs could quantitatively measure proteome-wide changes in DNA binding activity of TFs in response to exogenous stimulation by using a label-free MS-based quantification approach.

abstract = {Most proteomic studies use liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the peptides generated by the proteolysis of a biological sample. However, with the current methods it remains challenging to rapidly, consistently, reproducibly, accurately, and sensitively detect and quantify large fractions of proteomes across multiple samples. Here we present a new strategy that systematically queries sample sets for the presence and quantity of essentially any protein of interest. It consists of using the information available in fragment ion spectral libraries to mine the complete fragment ion maps generated using a data-independent acquisition method. For this study, the data were acquired on a fast, high resolution quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) instrument by repeatedly cycling through 32 consecutive 25-Da precursor isolation windows (swaths). This SWATH MS acquisition setup generates, in a single sample injection, time-resolved fragment ion spectra for all the analytes detectable within the 400-1200 m/z precursor range and the user-defined retention time window. We show that suitable combinations of fragment ions extracted from these data sets are sufficiently specific to confidently identify query peptides over a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude, even if the precursors of the queried peptides are not detectable in the survey scans. We also show that queried peptides are quantified with a consistency and accuracy comparable with that of selected reaction monitoring, the gold standard proteomic quantification method. Moreover, targeted data extraction enables ad libitum quantification refinement and dynamic extension of protein probing by iterative re-mining of the once-and-forever acquired data sets. This combination of unbiased, broad range precursor ion fragmentation and targeted data extraction alleviates most constraints of present proteomic methods and should be equally applicable to the comprehensive analysis of other classes of analytes, beyond proteomics.},

abstract = {The rise of systems biology implied a growing demand for highly sensitive techniques for the fast and consistent detection and quantification of target sets of proteins across multiple samples. This is only partly achieved by classical mass spectrometry or affinity-based methods. We applied a targeted proteomics approach based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to detect and quantify proteins expressed to a concentration below 50 copies/cell in total S. cerevisiae digests. The detection range can be extended to single-digit copies/cell and to proteins undetected by classical methods. We illustrate the power of the technique by the consistent and fast measurement of a network of proteins spanning the entire abundance range over a growth time course of S. cerevisiae transiting through a series of metabolic phases. We therefore demonstrate the potential of SRM-based proteomics to provide assays for the measurement of any set of proteins of interest in yeast at high-throughput and quantitative accuracy.},

The method, however, is limited in the number of peptides that can be measured in one run. This number can be markedly increased by scheduling the acquisition if the accurate retention time (RT) of each peptide is known. Here we present iRT, an empirically derived dimensionless peptide-specific value that allows for highly accurate RT prediction. The iRT of a peptide is a fixed number relative to a standard set of reference iRT-peptides that can be transferred across laboratories and chromatographic systems. We show that iRT facilitates the setup of multiplexed experiments with acquisition windows more than four times smaller compared to in silico RT predictions resulting in improved quantification accuracy. iRTs can be determined by any laboratory and shared transparently. The iRT concept has been implemented in Skyline, the most widely used software for MRM experiments.},

abstract = {Using decoy databases to estimate the number of false positive assignations is one of the most widely used methods to calculate false discovery rates in large-scale peptide identification studies. However, in spite of their widespread use, the decoy approach has not been fully standardized. In conjunction with target databases, decoy databases may be used separately or in the form of concatenated databases, allowing a competition strategy; depending on the method used, two alternative formulations are possible to calculate error rates. Although both methods are conservative, the separate database approach overestimates the number of false positive assignations due to the presence of MS/MS spectra produced by true peptides, while the concatenated approach calculates the error rate in a population that has a higher size than that obtained after searching a target database. In this work, we demonstrate that by analyzing as a whole the joint distribution of matches obtained after performing a separate database search, and applying the competition strategy, it is possible to make a more accurate calculation of false discovery rates. We show that both separate and concatenated approaches clearly overestimate error rates with respect to those calculated by the new algorithm, using several kinds of scores. We conclude that the new indicator provides a more sensitive alternative, and establishes for the first time a unique and integrated framework to calculate error rates in large-scale peptide identification studies.},

abstract = {Better prognostic predictors for invasive candidiasis (IC) are needed to tailor and individualize therapeutic decision-making and minimize its high morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether molecular profiling of IgG-antibody response to the whole soluble Candida proteome could reveal a prognostic signature that may serve to devise a clinical-outcome prediction model for IC and contribute to known IC prognostic factors. By serological proteome analysis and data-mining procedures, serum 31-IgG antibody-reactivity patterns were examined in 45 IC patients randomly split into training and test sets. Within the training cohort, unsupervised two-way hierarchical clustering and principal-component analyses segregated IC patients into two antibody-reactivity subgroups with distinct prognoses that were unbiased by traditional IC prognostic factors and other patients-related variables. Supervised discriminant analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation identified a five-IgG antibody-reactivity signature as the most simplified and accurate IC clinical-outcome predictor, from which an IC prognosis score (ICPS) was derived. Its robustness was confirmed in the test set. Multivariate logistic-regression and receiver-operating-characteristic curve analyses demonstrated that the ICPS was able to accurately discriminate IC patients at high risk for death from those at low risk and outperformed conventional IC prognostic factors. Further validation of the five-IgG antibody-reactivity signature on a multiplexed immunoassay supported the serological proteome analysis results. The five IgG antibodies incorporated in the ICPS made biologic sense and were associated either with good-prognosis and protective patterns (those to Met6p, Hsp90p, and Pgk1p, putative Candida virulence factors and antiapoptotic mediators) or with poor-prognosis and risk patterns (those to Ssb1p and Gap1p/Tdh3p, potential Candida proapoptotic mediators). We conclude that the ICPS, with additional refinement in future larger prospective cohorts, could be applicable to reliably predict patient clinical-outcome for individualized therapy of IC. Our data further provide insights into molecular mechanisms that may influence clinical outcome in IC and uncover potential targets for vaccine design and immunotherapy against IC.},

abstract = {The growing use of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry in proteomic analyses led us to investigate how to identify peptides by SRM using only a minimal number of fragment ions. By using a computational model of the SRM work flow we computed the potential interferences from other peptides in a given proteome. From these results, we selected the deterministic SRM addresses that contained sufficient information to confer peptide and protein identity that we termed unique ion signatures (UIS). We computationally showed that UIS comprised of only two transitions are diagnostic for >99\% of Escherichia coli proteins and >96\% of human proteins that possess a sequence-unique peptide. We demonstrated an example of experimental use of UIS using a modified SRM methodology to profile the E. coli tricarboxylic acid cycle from a single injection of cell lysate. In addition, we showed the potential of UIS to form the first functionally orthogonal approach to validate peptide assignments obtained from conventional analyses of MS/MS spectra. The UIS methodology is a novel deterministic peptide identification method for MS/MS spectra based on information content. These robust theoretical assays will have widespread use when integrated with previously collected MS/MS data and conventional proteomics technologies.},

Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.},

The aim of this review is to highlight some of these applications. Examples from our own research as well as from other published works are used to illustrate the 2D gel driven research in the areas of: 1) de novo sequencing and protein identification from organisms with no or incomplete genome sequences available; 2) alternative detection methods for modification specific proteomics; 3) identification of protein isoforms and modified proteins. With an example of the glycoprotein TIMP-1 protein we illustrate the unique properties of 2D gels for the separation and characterisation of multiply modified proteins. We also show that careful analysis of experimental and theoretical protein mass and pI can lead to the identification of unanticipated protein variants modified by for example proteolytic cleavage. Together this shows that there is an important niche for 2D gel-based proteomics, which compliments traditional LC-MS techniques for specific protein research purposes.},

abstract = {Malaria infections of mammals are initiated by the transmission of Plasmodium salivary gland sporozoites during an Anopheles mosquito vector bite. Sporozoites make their way through the skin and eventually to the liver, where they infect hepatocytes. Blocking this initial stage of infection is a promising malaria vaccine strategy. Therefore, comprehensively elucidating the protein composition of sporozoites will be invaluable in identifying novel targets for blocking infection. Previous efforts to identify the proteins expressed in Plasmodium mosquito stages were hampered by the technical difficulty of separating the parasite from its vector; without effective purifications, the large majority of proteins identified were of vector origin. Here we describe the proteomic profiling of highly purified salivary gland sporozoites from two Plasmodium species: human-infective Plasmodium falciparum and rodent-infective Plasmodium yoelii. The combination of improved sample purification and high mass accuracy mass spectrometry has facilitated the most complete proteome coverage to date for a pre-erythrocytic stage of the parasite. A total of 1991 P. falciparum sporozoite proteins and 1876 P. yoelii sporozoite proteins were identified, with >86\% identified with high sequence coverage. The proteomic data were used to confirm the presence of components of three features critical for sporozoite infection of the mammalian host: the sporozoite motility and invasion apparatus (glideosome), sporozoite signaling pathways, and the contents of the apical secretory organelles. Furthermore, chemical labeling and identification of proteins on live sporozoites revealed previously uncharacterized complexity of the putative sporozoite surface-exposed proteome. Taken together, the data constitute the most comprehensive analysis to date of the protein expression of salivary gland sporozoites and reveal novel potential surface-exposed proteins that might be valuable targets for antibody blockage of infection.},

abstract = {Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) is a technique for high-sensitivity targeted analysis. In proteomics, MRM-MS can be used to monitor and quantify a peptide based on the production of expected fragment peaks from the selected peptide precursor ion. The choice of which fragment ions to monitor in order to achieve maximum sensitivity in MRM-MS can potentially be guided by existing MS/MS spectra. However, because the majority of discovery experiments are performed on ion trap platforms, there is concern in the field regarding the generalizability of these spectra to MRM-MS on a triple quadrupole instrument. In light of this concern, many operators perform an optimization step to determine the most intense fragments for a target peptide on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. We have addressed this issue by targeting, on a triple quadrupole, the top six y-ion peaks from ion trap-derived consensus library spectra for 258 doubly charged peptides from three different sample sets and quantifying the observed elution curves. This analysis revealed a strong correlation between the y-ion peak rank order and relative intensity across platforms. This suggests that y-type ions obtained from ion trap-based library spectra are well-suited for generating MRM-MS assays for triple quadrupoles and that optimization is not required for each target peptide.},

abstract = {A general method for the quantification of proteins in human serum was developed using mass spectrometry (MS) and stable isotope-labeled synthetic peptides as internal standards. Using this approach, C-reactive protein (CRP), a diagnostic marker of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), was detected in serum samples taken from patients with either erosive or nonerosive RA and compared to healthy individuals. Small volumes of serum samples were enriched for low-abundance proteins through the selective removal of human serum albumin (HSA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and haptoglobin. After depletion of abundant proteins, the complexity of the protein mixture was further simplified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to fractionate denatured proteins into discrete molecular weight ranges. Fractions of interest containing CRP, M(r) = 25 000, were pooled, digested with trypsin, and then fixed quantities of the synthetic peptides were added to the mixture. The mixture of tryptic peptides was subsequently analyzed by nanoflow chromatography-tandem MS (nanoLC-MS/MS) using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQ-MS). The ratio of transition ions derived from the endogenous and isotope-labeled peptides provided a quantitative measure of CRP in the original samples as assessed by independent measurement of CRP in the same patient samples using an immunoassay. The use of isotope-labeled synthetic peptides and MRM is a powerful analytical method for the prescreening of candidate protein biomarkers in human serum prior to antibody and immunoassay development.},

abstract = {The Spanish team of the Human Proteome Project (SpHPP) marked the annotation of Chr16 and data analysis as one of its priorities. Precise annotation of Chromosome 16 proteins according to C-HPP criteria is presented. Moreover, Human Body Map 2.0 RNA-Seq and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data sets were used to obtain further information relative to cell/tissue specific chromosome 16 coding gene expression patterns and to infer the presence of missing proteins. Twenty-four shotgun 2D-LC-MS/MS and gel/LC-MS/MS MIAPE compliant experiments, representing 41\% coverage of chromosome 16 proteins, were performed. Furthermore, mapping of large-scale multicenter mass spectrometry data sets from CCD18, MCF7, Jurkat, and Ramos cell lines into RNA-Seq data allowed further insights relative to correlation of chromosome 16 transcripts and proteins. Detection and quantification of chromosome 16 proteins in biological matrices by SRM procedures are also primary goals of the SpHPP. Two strategies were undertaken: one focused on known proteins, taking advantage of MS data already available, and the second, aimed at the detection of the missing proteins, is based on the expression of recombinant proteins to gather MS information and optimize SRM methods that will be used in real biological samples. SRM methods for 49 known proteins and for recombinant forms of 24 missing proteins are reported in this study.},

However, orthologs of classical mammalian apoptosis regulators appeared to be missing from the yeast genome, challenging a common mechanism of yeast and mammalian apoptosis. Here we investigate Yor197w, a yeast protein with structural homology to mammalian caspases, and demonstrate caspase-like processing of the protein. Hydrogen peroxide treatment induces apoptosis together with a caspase-like enzymatic activity in yeast. This response is completely abrogated after disruption and strongly stimulated after overexpression of Yor197w. Yor197w also mediates the death process within chronologically aged cultures, pointing to a physiological role in elimination of overaged cells. We conclude that Yor197w indeed functions as a bona fide caspase in yeast and propose the name Yeast Caspase-1 (YCA1, gene YCA1).},

@article{Saville2003,
abstract = {It is widely assumed that the ability of Candida albicans to switch between different morphologies is required for pathogenesis. However, most virulence studies have used mutants that are permanently locked into either the yeast or filamentous forms which are avirulent but unsuitable for discerning the role of morphogenetic conversions at the various stages of the infectious process. We have constructed a strain in which this developmental transition can be externally modulated both in vitro and in vivo. This was achieved by placing one copy of the NRG1 gene (a negative regulator of filamentation) under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter. This modified strain was then tested in an animal model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis. Mice injected with this strain under conditions permitting hyphal development succumbed to the infection, whereas all of the animals injected under conditions that inhibited this transition survived. Importantly, fungal burdens were almost identical in both sets of animals, indicating that, whereas filament formation appears to be required for the mortality resulting from a deep-seated infection, yeast cells play an important role early in the infectious process by extravasating and disseminating to the target organs. Moreover, these infecting Candida yeast cells still retained their pathogenic potential, as demonstrated by allowing this developmental transition to occur at various time points postinfection. We demonstrate here the importance of morphogenetic conversions in C. albicans pathogenesis. This engineered strain should provide a useful tool in unraveling the individual contributions of the yeast and filamentous forms at various stages of the infectious process.},

Overall, 90\% of the targeted proteins, including families of isoenzymes, were consistently detected and quantified in each sample, generating a proteomic data set that represents a nutritionally perturbed biological system at high reproducibility. The data set is near comprehensive because we detect 95-99\% of all proteins that are required under a given condition. Interpreted through flux balance modeling, the data indicate that S. cerevisiae retains proteins not necessarily used in a particular environment. Further, the data suggest differential functionality for several metabolic isoenzymes.},

To achieve saturation coverage of a proteome or specific subproteome via tandem mass spectrometric identification of tryptic protein sample digests, proteomics data sets are growing dramatically in size and heterogeneity. The trend toward very large integrated data sets poses so far unsolved challenges to control the uncertainty of protein identifications going beyond well established confidence measures for peptide-spectrum matches. We present MAYU, a novel strategy that reliably estimates false discovery rates for protein identifications in large scale data sets. We validated and applied MAYU using various large proteomics data sets. The data show that the size of the data set has an important and previously underestimated impact on the reliability of protein identifications. We particularly found that protein false discovery rates are significantly elevated compared with those of peptide-spectrum matches. The function provided by MAYU is critical to control the quality of proteome data repositories and thereby to enhance any study relying on these data sources. The MAYU software is available as standalone software and also integrated into the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline.},

abstract = {PeptideProphet is a post-processing algorithm designed to evaluate the confidence in identifications of MS/MS spectra returned by a database search. In this manuscript we describe the "what and how" of PeptideProphet in a manner aimed at statisticians and life scientists who would like to gain a more in-depth understanding of the underlying statistical modeling. The theory and rationale behind the mixture-modeling approach taken by PeptideProphet is discussed from a statistical model-building perspective followed by a description of how a model can be used to express confidence in the identification of individual peptides or sets of peptides. We also demonstrate how to evaluate the quality of model fit and select an appropriate model from several available alternatives. We illustrate the use of PeptideProphet in association with the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, a free suite of software used for protein identification.},

@article{Malmstrom2012,
abstract = {Targeted proteomics allows researchers to study proteins of interest without being drowned in data from other, less interesting proteins or from redundant or uninformative peptides. While the technique is mostly used for smaller, focused studies, there are several reasons to conduct larger targeted experiments. Automated, highly robust software becomes more important in such experiments. In addition, larger experiments are carried out over longer periods of time, requiring strategies to handle the sometimes large shift in retention time often observed. We present a complete proof-of-principle software stack that automates most aspects of selected reaction monitoring workflows, a targeted proteomics technology. The software allows experiments to be easily designed and carried out. The steps automated are the generation of assays, generation of mass spectrometry driver files and methods files, and the import and analysis of the data. All data are normalized to a common retention time scale, the data are then scored using a novel score model, and the error is subsequently estimated. We also show that selected reaction monitoring can be used for label-free quantification. All data generated are stored in a relational database, and the growing resource further facilitates the design of new experiments. We apply the technology to a large-scale experiment studying how Streptococcus pyogenes remodels its proteome under stimulation of human plasma.},

@article{Surinova2013,
abstract = {Targeted proteomics based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry is commonly used for accurate and reproducible quantification of protein analytes in complex biological mixtures. Strictly hypothesis-driven, SRM assays quantify each targeted protein by collecting measurements on its peptide fragment ions, called transitions. To achieve sensitive and accurate quantitative results, experimental design and data analysis must consistently account for the variability of the quantified transitions. This consistency is especially important in large experiments, which increasingly require profiling up to hundreds of proteins over hundreds of samples. Here we describe a robust and automated workflow for the analysis of large quantitative SRM data sets that integrates data processing, statistical protein identification and quantification, and dissemination of the results. The integrated workflow combines three software tools: mProphet for peptide identification via probabilistic scoring; SRMstats for protein significance analysis with linear mixed-effect models; and PASSEL, a public repository for storage, retrieval and query of SRM data. The input requirements for the protocol are files with SRM traces in mzXML format, and a file with a list of transitions in a text tab-separated format. The protocol is especially suited for data with heavy isotope-labeled peptide internal standards. We demonstrate the protocol on a clinical data set in which the abundances of 35 biomarker candidates were profiled in 83 blood plasma samples of subjects with ovarian cancer or benign ovarian tumors. The time frame to realize the protocol is 1-2 weeks, depending on the number of replicates used in the experiment.},

@article{Anderson2006,
abstract = {Quantitative LC-MS/MS assays were designed for tryptic peptides representing 53 high and medium abundance proteins in human plasma using a multiplexed multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) approach. Of these, 47 produced acceptable quantitative data, demonstrating within-run coefficients of variation (CVs) (n = 10) of 2-22\% (78\% of assays had CV <10\%). A number of peptides gave CVs in the range 2-7\% in five experiments (10 replicate runs each) continuously measuring 137 MRMs, demonstrating the precision achievable in complex digests. Depletion of six high abundance proteins by immunosubtraction significantly improved CVs compared with whole plasma, but analytes could be detected in both sample types. Replicate digest and depletion/digest runs yielded correlation coefficients (R(2)) of 0.995 and 0.989, respectively. Absolute analyte specificity for each peptide was demonstrated using MRM-triggered MS/MS scans. Reliable detection of L-selectin (measured at 0.67 microg/ml) indicates that proteins down to the microg/ml level can be quantitated in plasma with minimal sample preparation, yielding a dynamic range of 4.5 orders of magnitude in a single experiment. Peptide MRM measurements in plasma digests thus provide a rapid and specific assay platform for biomarker validation, one that can be extended to lower abundance proteins by enrichment of specific target peptides (stable isotope standards and capture by anti-peptide antibodies (SISCAPA)).},

Three conceptually different methods to perform quantitative LC-MS experiments have been introduced. In the first, quantification is achieved by spectral counting, in the second via differential stable isotopic labeling, and in the third by using the ion current in label-free LC-MS measurements. We discuss here advantages and challenges of each quantification approach and assess available software solutions with respect to their instrument compatibility and processing functionality. This review therefore serves as a starting point for researchers to choose an appropriate software solution for quantitative proteomic experiments based on their experimental and analytical requirements.},

abstract = {Quantifying the similarity of spectra is an important task in various areas of spectroscopy, e.g. to identify a compound by comparing sample spectra to those of reference standards. In mass spectrometry based discovery proteomics, spectral comparisons are used to infer the amino acid sequence of peptides. In targeted proteomics by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) or SWATH MS, predetermined sets of fragment ion signals integrated over chromatographic time are used to identify target peptides in complex samples. In both cases, confidence in peptide identification is directly related to the quality of spectral matches. In this study, we used sets of simulated spectra of well-controlled dissimilarity to benchmark different spectral comparison measures and to develop a robust scoring scheme that quantifies the similarity of fragment ion spectra. We applied the normalized contrast spectral angle score to quantify the similarity of spectra to objectively assess fragment ion variability of tandem mass spectrometric datasets, to evaluate portability of peptide fragment ion spectra for targeted mass spectrometry across different types of mass spectrometers and to discriminate target assays from decoys in targeted proteomics. Altogether, this study validates the use of the normalized spectral contrast angle as a sensitive spectral similarity measure for targeted proteomics, and more generally provides a methodology to assess the performance of spectral comparisons and to support the rational selection of the most appropriate similarity measure. The algorithms used in this study are made publicly available as an open source toolset with a graphical user interface.},

abstract = {The cellular abundance of transcription factors (TFs) is an important determinant of their regulatory activities. Deriving TF copy numbers is therefore crucial to understanding how these proteins control gene expression. We describe a sensitive selected reaction monitoring-based mass spectrometry assay that allowed us to determine the copy numbers of up to ten proteins simultaneously. We applied this approach to profile the absolute levels of key TFs, including PPAR$\gamma$ and RXR$\alpha$, during terminal differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Our analyses revealed that individual TF abundance differs dramatically (from ∼250 to >300,000 copies per nucleus) and that their dynamic range during differentiation can vary up to fivefold. We also formulated a DNA binding model for PPAR$\gamma$ based on TF copy number, binding energetics and local chromatin state. This model explains the increase in PPAR$\gamma$ binding sites during the final differentiation stage that occurs despite a concurrent saturation in PPAR$\gamma$ copy number.},

We observed that these partners are required for the Ubp3-Bre5-dependent and starvation-induced selective degradation of yeast mature ribosomes, also called ribophagy. By contrast, proteasome-dependent degradation does not participate in this process. Our data favour the idea that these factors cooperate to recognize and deubiquitinate specific substrates of ribophagy before their vacuolar degradation.},

The equieffective concentrations of the K72A-, K72E- and K72L-substituted mutants of cytochrome c were five-, 15- and 70-fold higher. The "yeast --> horse" hybrid created by introducing S2D, K4E, A7K, T8K, and K11V substitutions (horse protein numbering) and deleting five N-terminal residues in yeast cytochrome c did not evoke apoptotic activity in mammalian cells. The apoptotic function of cytochrome c was abolished by the K72W substitution. The K72W-substituted cytochrome c possesses reduced affinity to the apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and forms an inactive complex. This mutant is competent as a respiratory-chain electron carrier and well suited for knock-in studies of cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis.},

abstract = {The combination of tandem mass spectrometry and sequence database searching is the method of choice for the identification of peptides and the mapping of proteomes. Over the last several years, the volume of data generated in proteomic studies has increased dramatically, which challenges the computational approaches previously developed for these data. Furthermore, a multitude of search engines have been developed that identify different, overlapping subsets of the sample peptides from a particular set of tandem mass spectrometry spectra. We present iProphet, the new addition to the widely used open-source suite of proteomic data analysis tools Trans-Proteomics Pipeline. Applied in tandem with PeptideProphet, it provides more accurate representation of the multilevel nature of shotgun proteomic data. iProphet combines the evidence from multiple identifications of the same peptide sequences across different spectra, experiments, precursor ion charge states, and modified states. It also allows accurate and effective integration of the results from multiple database search engines applied to the same data. The use of iProphet in the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline increases the number of correctly identified peptides at a constant false discovery rate as compared with both PeptideProphet and another state-of-the-art tool Percolator. As the main outcome, iProphet permits the calculation of accurate posterior probabilities and false discovery rate estimates at the level of sequence identical peptide identifications, which in turn leads to more accurate probability estimates at the protein level. Fully integrated with the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline, it supports all commonly used MS instruments, search engines, and computer platforms. The performance of iProphet is demonstrated on two publicly available data sets: data from a human whole cell lysate proteome profiling experiment representative of typical proteomic data sets, and from a set of Streptococcus pyogenes experiments more representative of organism-specific composite data sets.},

The most common method is to use a search algorithm to identify peptides by correlating experimental and theoretical MS/MS data (the latter being generated from possible peptides in the protein sequence database). Identified peptides are collated and protein entries from the sequence database inferred.

abstract = {Caspofungin exerts candidacidal activity by inhibiting cell wall (1,3)-$\beta$-d-glucan synthesis. We investigated the physiologic mechanisms of caspofungin-induced Candida albicans cell death. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) and necrosis were studied after C. albicans SC5314 cells were exposed to caspofungin at 0.06, 0.125, and 0.5 $\mu$g/ml (0.5×, 1×, and 4× the MIC, respectively) for 3 h. Caspofungin at 0.125 and 0.5 $\mu$g/ml reduced cellular viability by >50\%, as measured by colony counts and methylene blue exclusion. Apoptosis and necrosis were demonstrated by annexin V and propidium iodide staining for phosphatidylserine externalization and loss of membrane integrity, respectively. At all concentrations of caspofungin, 20 to 25\% and 5 to 7\% of C. albicans cells exhibited early apoptosis and late apoptosis/necrosis, respectively (P value was not significant [NS]). Necrosis, on the other hand, was significantly greater at 0.125 (43\%) and 0.5 (48\%) $\mu$g/ml than at 0.06 $\mu$g/ml (26\%) (P values of 0.003 and 0.003, respectively). The induction of apoptosis at concentrations less than or equal to the MIC was corroborated by dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR-123) and dihydroethidium (DHE) staining (reactive oxygen species production), JC-1 staining (mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining (DNA damage and nuclear fragmentation). Moreover, electron microscopy of cells exposed to 0.125 $\mu$g/ml of caspofungin showed hallmark apoptotic features like chromatin margination and condensation and nuclear blebs. Apoptosis was associated with metacaspase 1 activation, as demonstrated by D2R staining. Caspofungin exerts activity against C. albicans by directly killing cells (resulting in necrosis) and causing others to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Apoptosis is initiated at subinhibitory concentrations, suggesting that strategies to target this process may augment the benefits of antifungal agents.},

A particular attention is paid to the problem of false-positive identifications. Existing statistical approaches for assessing the significance of peptide to spectrum matches are surveyed, ranging from single-spectrum approaches such as expectation values to global error rate estimation procedures such as false discovery rates and posterior probabilities. The importance of using auxiliary discriminant information (mass accuracy, peptide separation coordinates, digestion properties, and etc.) is discussed, and advanced computational approaches for joint modeling of multiple sources of information are presented. This review also includes a detailed analysis of the issues affecting the interpretation of data at the protein level, including the amplification of error rates when going from peptide to protein level, and the ambiguities in inferring the identifies of sample proteins in the presence of shared peptides. Commonly used methods for computing protein-level confidence scores are discussed in detail. The review concludes with a discussion of several outstanding computational issues.},

abstract = {Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a targeted mass spectrometry technique that provides sensitive and accurate protein detection and quantification in complex biological mixtures. Statistical and computational tools are essential for the design and analysis of SRM experiments, particularly in studies with large sample throughput. Currently, most such tools focus on the selection of optimized transitions and on processing signals from SRM assays. Little attention is devoted to protein significance analysis, which combines the quantitative measurements for a protein across isotopic labels, peptides, charge states, transitions, samples, and conditions, and detects proteins that change in abundance between conditions while controlling the false discovery rate. We propose a statistical modeling framework for protein significance analysis. It is based on linear mixed-effects models and is applicable to most experimental designs for both isotope label-based and label-free SRM workflows. We illustrate the utility of the framework in two studies: one with a group comparison experimental design and the other with a time course experimental design. We further verify the accuracy of the framework in two controlled data sets, one from the NCI-CPTAC reproducibility investigation and the other from an in-house spike-in study. The proposed framework is sensitive and specific, produces accurate results in broad experimental circumstances, and helps to optimally design future SRM experiments. The statistical framework is implemented in an open-source R-based software package SRMstats, and can be used by researchers with a limited statistics background as a stand-alone tool or in integration with the existing computational pipelines.},

The approach is based on the assumption that each protein present in a sample reproducibly and predictably generates a relatively small number of peptides that can be identified by mass spectrometry. In this study this assumption was examined by a targeted peptide sequencing strategy using inclusion lists to trigger peptide fragmentation attempts. It was found that the number of peptides observed from a single protein is at least one order of magnitude greater than previously assumed. This unexpected complexity of proteomics samples implies substantial technical challenges, explains some perplexing results in the proteomics literature, and prompts the need for developing alternative experimental strategies for the rapid and comprehensive analysis of proteomes.},

Employing the expectation maximization algorithm, the analysis learns to distinguish correct from incorrect database search results, computing probabilities that peptide assignments to spectra are correct based upon database search scores and the number of tryptic termini of peptides. Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides. This analysis makes it possible to filter large volumes of MS/MS database search results with predictable false identification error rates and can serve as a common standard by which the results of different research groups are compared.},

abstract = {During the past years, yeast has been successfully established as a model to study mechanisms of apoptotic regulation. However, the beneficial effects of such a cell suicide program for a unicellular organism remained obscure. Here, we demonstrate that chronologically aged yeast cultures die exhibiting typical markers of apoptosis, accumulate oxygen radicals, and show caspase activation. Age-induced cell death is strongly delayed by overexpressing YAP1, a key transcriptional regulator in oxygen stress response. Disruption of apoptosis through deletion of yeast caspase YCA1 initially results in better survival of aged cultures. However, surviving cells lose the ability of regrowth, indicating that predamaged cells accumulate in the absence of apoptotic cell removal. Moreover, wild-type cells outlast yca1 disruptants in direct competition assays during long-term aging. We suggest that apoptosis in yeast confers a selective advantage for this unicellular organism, and demonstrate that old yeast cells release substances into the medium that stimulate survival of the clone.},

CandidaDB is based on an annotation of the Stanford Genome Technology Center C.albicans genome sequence data by the European Galar Fungail Consortium. CandidaDB Release 2.0 (June 2004) contains information pertaining to Assembly 19 of the genome of C.albicans strain SC5314. The current release contains 6244 annotated entries corresponding to 130 tRNA genes and 5917 protein-coding genes. For these, it provides tentative functional assignments along with numerous pre-run analyses that can assist the researcher in the evaluation of gene function for the purpose of specific or large-scale analysis. CandidaDB is based on GenoList, a generic relational data schema and a World Wide Web interface that has been adapted to the handling of eukaryotic genomes. The interface allows users to browse easily through genome data and retrieve information. CandidaDB also provides more elaborate tools, such as pattern searching, that are tightly connected to the overall browsing system. As the C.albicans genome is diploid and still incompletely assembled, CandidaDB provides tools to browse the genome by individual supercontigs and to examine information about allelic sequences obtained from complementary contigs.

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) quantitation of proteins can dramatically impact the discovery and quantitation of biomarkers via rapid, targeted, multiplexed protein expression profiling of clinical samples. A mixture of 45 peptide standards, easily adaptable to common plasma proteomics work flows, was created to permit absolute quantitation of 45 endogenous proteins in human plasma trypsin digests. All experiments were performed on simple tryptic digests of human EDTA-plasma without prior affinity depletion or enrichment. Stable isotope-labeled standard peptides were added immediately following tryptic digestion because addition of stable isotope-labeled standard peptides prior to trypsin digestion was found to generate elevated and unpredictable results. Proteotypic tryptic peptides containing isotopically coded amino acids ([(13)C(6)]Arg or [(13)C(6)]Lys) were synthesized for all 45 proteins. Peptide purity was assessed by capillary zone electrophoresis, and the peptide quantity was determined by amino acid analysis. For maximum sensitivity and specificity, instrumental parameters were empirically determined to generate the most abundant precursor ions and y ion fragments. Concentrations of individual peptide standards in the mixture were optimized to approximate endogenous concentrations of analytes and to ensure the maximum linear dynamic range of the MRM assays. Excellent linear responses (r > 0.99) were obtained for 43 of the 45 proteins with attomole level limits of quantitation (<20\% coefficient of variation) for 27 of the 45 proteins. Analytical precision for 44 of the 45 assays varied by <10\%. LC-MRM/MS analyses performed on 3 different days on different batches of plasma trypsin digests resulted in coefficients of variation of <20\% for 42 of the 45 assays. Concentrations for 39 of the 45 proteins are within a factor of 2 of reported literature values. This mixture of internal standards has many uses and can be applied to the characterization of trypsin digestion kinetics and plasma protein expression profiling because 31 of the 45 proteins are putative biomarkers of cardiovascular disease.},

PeptideAtlas (http://www.peptideatlas.org/) addresses these needs by identifying peptides by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), statistically validating those identifications and then mapping identified sequences to the genomes of eukaryotic organisms. A meaningful comparison of data across different experiments generated by different groups using different types of instruments is enabled by the implementation of a uniform analytic process. This uniform statistical validation ensures a consistent and high-quality set of peptide and protein identifications. The raw data from many diverse proteomic experiments are made available in the associated PeptideAtlas repository in several formats.

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples. CR  - Copyright \&\#169; 1995 Royal Statistical Society},

However, the peptide-centric nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins. In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent informatic approaches.

It was found that apoptotic stimulation with amphotericin B, acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells, caspase activity and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, whereas it decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP level in the cap1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant. The cell fate was, at least partly, caused by glutathione depletion and attenuation of the expression of the glutathione reductase gene in the cap1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant. Collectively, our data suggest that Cap1p participated in the apoptosis of C. albicans by regulating the expression of the glutathione reductase gene and glutathione content.},

abstract = {Aging is believed to be a nonadaptive process that escapes the force of natural selection. Here, we challenge this dogma by showing that yeast laboratory strains and strains isolated from grapes undergo an age- and pH-dependent death with features of mammalian programmed cell death (apoptosis). After 90-99\% of the population dies, a small mutant subpopulation uses the nutrients released by dead cells to grow. This adaptive regrowth is inversely correlated with protection against superoxide toxicity and life span and is associated with elevated age-dependent release of nutrients and increased mutation frequency. Computational simulations confirm that premature aging together with a relatively high mutation frequency can result in a major advantage in adaptation to changing environments. These results suggest that under conditions that model natural environments, yeast organisms undergo an altruistic and premature aging and death program, mediated in part by superoxide. The role of similar pathways in the regulation of longevity in organisms ranging from yeast to mice raises the possibility that mammals may also undergo programmed aging.},

Peptides that correspond to more than a single protein in the sequence database are apportioned among all corresponding proteins, and a minimal protein list sufficient to account for the observed peptide assignments is derived using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Using peptide assignments to spectra generated from a sample of 18 purified proteins, as well as complex H. influenzae and Halobacterium samples, the model is shown to produce probabilities that are accurate and have high power to discriminate correct from incorrect protein identifications. This method allows filtering of large-scale proteomics data sets with predictable sensitivity and false positive identification error rates. Fast, consistent, and transparent, it provides a standard for publishing large-scale protein identification data sets in the literature and for comparing the results obtained from different experiments.},

abstract = {The advent of quantitative proteomics opens new opportunities in biomedical and clinical research. Although quantitative proteomics methods based on stable isotope labeling are in general preferred for biomolecular research, biomarker discovery is a case example of a biomedical problem that may be better addressed by using label-free MS techniques. As a proof of concept of this paradigm, we report the use of label-free quantitative LC-MS to profile the urinary peptidome of kidney chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD). The aim was to identify predictive biomarkers that could be used to personalize immunosuppressive therapies for kidney transplant patients. We detected (by LC-M/MS) and quantified (by LC-MS) 6000 polypeptide ions in undigested urine specimens across 39 CAD patients and 32 control individuals. Although unsupervised hierarchical clustering differentiated between the groups when including all the identified peptides, specific peptides derived from uromodulin and kininogen were found to be significantly more abundant in control than in CAD patients and correctly identified the two groups. These peptides are therefore potential biomarkers that might be used for the diagnosis of CAD. In addition, ions at m/z 645.59 and m/z 642.61 were able to differentiate between patients with different forms of CAD with specificities and sensitivities of 90\% in a training set and, significantly, of approximately 70\% in an independent validation set of samples. Interestingly low expression of uromodulin at m/z 638.03 coupled with high expression of m/z 642.61 diagnosed CAD in virtually all cases. Multiple reaction monitoring experiments further validated the results, illustrating the power of our label-free quantitative LC-MS approach for obtaining quantitative profiles of urinary polypeptides in a rapid, comprehensive, and precise fashion and for biomarker discovery.},

abstract = {Candida albicans yeast-to-hypha morphological transition is involved in the virulence strategy of this opportunistic fungal pathogen. Changes in relative abundance of the Candida proteome related to this process were analyzed using different two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE)-based approaches. First, a comparative analysis of yeast and hyphal cytoplasmic proteins allowed the detection of 106 protein spots with significant variation in abundance. Sixty-one of them, corresponding to 46 proteins, were identified. As most of the differentially abundant proteins had an acidic isoelectric point, a large-scale prefractionation approach to analyze the acidic C. albicans subproteome was carried out. Ninety acidic C. albicans proteins were identified by either gel-based or nongel-based approaches. Additionally, different workflows combining preparative isoelectric focusing, Cy labeling, and narrow pH gradient 2-DE gels were tested to analyze the differences in relative protein abundance between yeast and hyphal acidic subproteomes. It was possible to identify 21 differentially abundant acidic proteins; 10 of them were not identified in the previous 2D-DIGE gels. Functional and network interaction analyses of the 56 differentially abundant proteins identified by both approaches rendered an integrated view of metabolic and cellular process reorganization during the yeast-to-hypha transition. With these results, we propose a model of metabolic reorganization.},

abstract = {Several algorithms have been described in the literature for protein identification by searching a sequence database using mass spectrometry data. In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},

We would advocate the widespread use of these simple statistical measures to simplify and standardize the reporting of the confidence of protein identification results, allowing the users of different identification algorithms to compare their results in a straightforward and statistically significant manner. A method is described for measuring these distributions using information that is being discarded by most protein identification search engines, resulting in accurate survival functions that are specific to any combination of scoring algorithms, sequence databases, and mass spectra.},

abstract = {The interaction of Candida albicans with macrophages is considered a crucial step in the development of an adequate immune response in systemic candidiasis. An in vitro model of phagocytosis that includes a differential staining procedure to discriminate between internalized and non-internalized yeast was developed. Upon optimization of a protocol to obtain an enriched population of ingested yeasts, a thorough genomics and proteomics analysis was carried out on these cells. Both proteins and mRNA were obtained from the same sample and analyzed in parallel. The combination of two-dimensional PAGE with MS revealed a total of 132 differentially expressed yeast protein species upon macrophage interaction. Among these species, 67 unique proteins were identified. This is the first time that a proteomics approach has been used to study C. albicans-macrophage interaction. We provide evidence of a rapid protein response of the fungus to adapt to the new environment inside the phagosome by changing the expression of proteins belonging to different pathways. The clear down-regulation of the carbon-compound metabolism, plus the up-regulation of lipid, fatty acid, glyoxylate, and tricarboxylic acid cycles, indicates that yeast shifts to a starvation mode. There is an important activation of the degradation and detoxification protein machinery. The complementary genomics approach led to the detection of specific pathways related to the virulence of Candida. Network analyses allowed us to generate a hypothetical model of Candida cell death after macrophage interaction, highlighting the interconnection between actin cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and autophagy in the regulation of apoptosis. In conclusion, the combination of genomics, proteomics, and network analyses is a powerful strategy to better understand the complex host-pathogen interactions.},

At the same time advances in protein and DNA sequencing technology are resulting in an exponential increase in the number of sequences deposited in databases. Here we investigate the possibility to use mass spectrometric data to identify proteins in databases. Searching a database by total molecular weight is found to be an easy and sometimes sufficient approach. For more specificity and for error tolerance in both the mass spectrometric data and the database information we search by partial mass spectrometric peptide map of the protein. In general, just four to six proteolytic peptides measured with a mass accuracy between 0.1 and 0.01\% allow a useful search of databases such as the Protein Identification Resource (PIR). As the size of DNA and protein sequence databases grows, protein identification by partial mass spectrometric peptide maps should become increasingly powerful and may become a general method to identify and characterize proteins.},

abstract = {New antifungal agents are urgently required to combat life-threatening infections caused by opportunistic fungal pathogens like Candida albicans. The manipulation of endogenous fungal programmed cell death responses could provide a basis for future therapies. Here we assess the physiology of death in C. albicans in response to environmental stresses (acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide) and an antifungal agent (amphotericin B). Exposure of C. albicans to 40-60 mM acetic acid, 5-10 mM hydrogen peroxide, or 4-8 microg.ml-1 amphotericin B produced cellular changes reminiscent of mammalian apoptosis. Nonviable cells that excluded propidium iodide displayed the apoptotic marker phosphatidylserine (as shown by annexin-V-FITC labeling), were terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive (indicating nuclease-mediated double-strand DNA breakage), and produced reactive oxygen species. Ultrastructural changes in apoptotic cells included chromatin condensation and margination, separation of the nuclear envelope, and nuclear fragmentation. C. albicans cells treated at higher doses of these compounds showed cellular changes characteristic of necrosis. Necrotic cells displayed reduced TUNEL staining, a lack of surface phosphatidylserine, limited reactive oxygen species production, and an inability to exclude propidium iodide. Necrotic cells lacked defined nuclei and showed extensive intracellular vacuolization. Apoptosis in C. albicans was associated with an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and under some apoptosis-inducing conditions, significant proportions of yeast cells switched to hyphal growth before dying. This is a demonstration of apoptosis in a medically important fungal pathogen.},

With the rapid advances in mass spectrometry technology and methods, it has become imperative to provide a standard output format for mass spectrometry data that will facilitate data sharing and analysis. Initially, the efforts to develop a standard format for mass spectrometry data resulted in multiple formats, each designed with a different underlying philosophy. To resolve the issues associated with having multiple formats, vendors, researchers, and software developers convened under the banner of the HUPO PSI to develop a single standard. The new data format incorporated many of the desirable technical attributes from the previous data formats, while adding a number of improvements, including features such as a controlled vocabulary with validation tools to ensure consistent usage of the format, improved support for selected reaction monitoring data, and immediately available implementations to facilitate rapid adoption by the community. The resulting standard data format, mzML, is a well tested open-source format for mass spectrometer output files that can be readily utilized by the community and easily adapted for incremental advances in mass spectrometry technology.},

abstract = {Advances in biological mass spectrometry have resulted in the development of numerous strategies for the large-scale quantification of protein expression levels within cells. These measurements of protein expression are most commonly accomplished through differential incorporation of stable isotopes into cellular proteins. Several variations of the stable isotope quantification method have been demonstrated, differing in isotope composition and incorporation strategy. In general, the majority of these methods establish only relative quantification of expressed proteins. To address this, the absolute quantification (AQUA) strategy was developed for the precise determination of protein expression and post-translational modification levels. The AQUA method relies on the use of a synthetic internal standard peptide that is introduced at a known concentration to cell lysates during digestion. This AQUA peptide precisely mimics a peptide produced during proteolysis of the target protein, except that it is enriched in certain stable isotopes. Analysis of the proteolyzed sample by a selected reaction monitoring (SRM) experiment in a tandem mass spectrometer results in the direct detection and quantification of both the native peptide and isotope labeled AQUA internal standard peptide. As an example, the development and application of a method to measure a tryptic peptide representing the amount of polyubiquitin chain formation through lysine 48 (K48) is presented. The simplicity and sensitivity of the method, coupled with the widespread availability of tandem mass spectrometers, make the AQUA strategy a highly useful procedure for measuring the levels of proteins and post-translational modifications directly from cell lysates.},

abstract = {Candida albicans is the most common human fungal pathogen. Recent evidence has revealed the occurrence of apoptosis in C. albicans that is inducible by environmental stresses such as hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and amphotericin B. Apoptosis is regulated by the calcineurin-caspase pathway in C. albicans, and calcineurin is under the control of Hsp90 in echinocandin resistance. However, the role of Hsp90 in apoptosis of C. albicans remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Hsp90 in apoptosis of C. albicans by using an Hsp90-compromised strain tetO-HSP90/hsp90 and found that upon apoptotic stimuli, including hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid or amphotericin B treatment, less apoptosis occurred, less ROS was produced, and more cells survived in the Hsp90-compromised strain compared with the Hsp90/Hsp90 wild-type strain. In addition, Hsp90-compromised cells were defective in up-regulating caspase-encoding gene CaMCA1 expression and activating caspase activity upon the apoptotic stimuli. Investigations on the relationship between Hsp90 and calcineurin revealed that activation of calcineurin could up-regulate apoptosis but could not further down-regulate apoptosis in Hsp90-compromised cells, indicating that calcineurin was downstream of Hsp90. Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GdA) could further decrease the apoptosis in calcineurin-pathway-defect strains, indicating that compromising Hsp90 function had a stronger effect than compromising calcineurin function on apoptosis. Collectively, this study demonstrated that compromised Hsp90 reduced apoptosis in C. albicans, partially through downregulating the calcineurin-caspase pathway.},

Selected reaction monitoring (SRM)also called multiple reaction monitoringis emerging as a technology that ideally complements the discovery capabilities of shotgun strategies by its unique potential for reliable quantification of analytes of low abundance in complex mixtures. In an SRM experiment, a predefined precursor ion and one of its fragments are selected by the two mass filters of a triple quadrupole instrument and monitored over time for precise quantification. A series of transitions (precursor/fragment ion pairs) in combination with the retention time of the targeted peptide can constitute a definitive assay. Typically, a large number of peptides are quantified during a single LC-MS experiment. This tutorial explains the application of SRM for quantitative proteomics, including the selection of proteotypic peptides and the optimization and validation of transitions. Furthermore, normalization and various factors affecting sensitivity and accuracy are discussed.},

Analysis of the PA with respect to biophysical properties of constituent peptides, functional properties of parent proteins of detected peptides, and performance of different mass spectrometry approaches has highlighted plausible strategies for improving proteome coverage and selecting signature peptides for targeted proteomics. Notably, discovery of a significant correlation between absolute abundances of mRNAs and proteins has helped identify low abundance of proteins as the major limitation in peptide detection. Furthermore, we have discovered that iTRAQ labeling for quantitative proteomic analysis introduces a significant bias in peptide detection by mass spectrometry. Therefore, despite identifying at least one proteotypic peptide for almost all proteins in the PA, a context-dependent selection of proteotypic peptides appears to be the most effective approach for targeted proteomics.},

These synthetic peptides can also be prepared with covalent modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, etc.) that are chemically identical to naturally occurring posttranslational modifications. Such AQUA internal standard peptides are then used to precisely and quantitatively measure the absolute levels of proteins and posttranslationally modified proteins after proteolysis by using a selected reaction monitoring analysis in a tandem mass spectrometer. In the present work, the AQUA strategy was used to (i) quantify low abundance yeast proteins involved in gene silencing, (ii) quantitatively determine the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-1126 of human separase protein, and (iii) identify kinases capable of phosphorylating Ser-1501 of separase in an in vitro kinase assay.

abstract = {A crucial part of a successful systems biology experiment is an assay that provides reliable, quantitative measurements for each of the components in the system being studied. For proteomics to be a key part of such studies, it must deliver accurate quantification of all the components in the system for each tested perturbation without any gaps in the data. This will require a new approach to proteomics that is based on emerging targeted quantitative mass spectrometry techniques. The PeptideAtlas Project comprises a growing, publicly accessible database of peptides identified in many tandem mass spectrometry proteomics studies and software tools that allow the building of PeptideAtlas, as well as its use by the research community. Here, we describe the PeptideAtlas Project, its contents and components, and show how together they provide a unique platform to select and validate mass spectrometry targets, thereby allowing the next revolution in proteomics.},

abstract = {We report a high-quality and system-wide proteome catalogue covering 71\% (3,542 proteins) of the predicted genes of fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, presenting the largest protein dataset to date for this important model organism. We obtained this high proteome and peptide (11.4 peptides/protein) coverage by a combination of extensive sample fractionation, high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and combined database searching using the iProphet software as part of the Trans- Proteomics Pipeline. All raw and processed data are made accessible in the S. pombe PeptideAtlas. The identified proteins showed no biases in functional properties and allowed global estimation of protein abundances. The high coverage of the PeptideAtlas allowed correlation with transcriptomic data in a system-wide manner indicating that post-transcriptional processes control the levels of at least half of all identified proteins. Interestingly, the correlation was not equally tight for all functional categories ranging from rs>0.80 for proteins involved in translation to rs<0.45 for signal transduction proteins. Moreover, many proteins involved in DNA damage repair could not be detected in the PeptideAtlas despite their high mRNA levels, strengthening the translation-on-demand hypothesis for members of this protein class. In summary, the extensive and public available S. pombe PeptideAtlas together with the generated proteotypic peptide spectral library will be a useful resource for future targeted, in-depth and quantitative proteomic studies on this microorganism.},

abstract = {Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is a powerful tandem mass spectrometry method that can be used to monitor target peptides within a complex protein digest. The specificity and sensitivity of the approach, as well as its capability to multiplex the measurement of many analytes in parallel, has made it a technology of particular promise for hypothesis driven proteomics. An underappreciated step in the development of an assay to measure many peptides in parallel is the time and effort necessary to establish a usable assay. Here we report the use of shotgun proteomics data to expedite the selection of SRM transitions for target peptides of interest. The use of tandem mass spectrometry data acquired on an LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer can accurately predict which fragment ions will produce the greatest signal in an SRM assay using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Furthermore, we present a scoring routine that can compare the targeted SRM chromatogram data with an MS/MS spectrum acquired by data-dependent acquisition and stored in a library. This scoring routine is invaluable in determining which signal in the chromatogram from a complex mixture best represents the target peptide. These algorithmic developments have been implemented in a software package that is available from the authors upon request.},

abstract = {The term proteomics encompasses the large-scale detection and analysis of proteins and their post-translational modifications. Driven by major improvements in mass spectrometric instrumentation, methodology and data analysis, the proteomics field has burgeoned in recent years. It now provides a range of sensitive and quantitative approaches for measuring protein structures and dynamics that promise to revolutionize our understanding of cell biology and molecular mechanisms in both human cells and model organisms. The Proteomics Specification in Time and Space (PROSPECTS) Network is a unique EU-funded project that brings together leading European research groups, spanning from instrumentation to biomedicine, in a collaborative five year initiative to develop new methods and applications for the functional analysis of cellular proteins. This special issue of Molecular and Cellular Proteomics presents 16 research papers reporting major recent progress by the PROSPECTS groups, including improvements to the resolution and sensitivity of the Orbitrap family of mass spectrometers, systematic detection of proteins using highly characterized antibody collections and new methods for absolute as well as relative quantification of protein levels. Manuscripts in this issue exemplify approaches for performing quantitative measurements of cell proteomes and for studying their dynamic responses to perturbation, both during normal cellular responses and in disease mechanisms. Here we present a perspective on how the proteomics field is moving beyond simply identifying proteins with high sensitivity towards providing a powerful and versatile set of assay systems for characterizing proteome dynamics and thereby creating a new third generation proteomics strategy that offers an indispensible tool for cell biology and molecular medicine.},

@article{Fendt2010,
abstract = {Which transcription factors control the distribution of metabolic fluxes under a given condition? We address this question by systematically quantifying metabolic fluxes in 119 transcription factor deletion mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under five growth conditions. While most knockouts did not affect fluxes, we identified 42 condition-dependent interactions that were mediated by a total of 23 transcription factors that control almost exclusively the cellular decision between respiration and fermentation. This relatively sparse, condition-specific network of active metabolic control contrasts with the much larger gene regulation network inferred from expression and DNA binding data. Based on protein and transcript analyses in key mutants, we identified three enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle as the key targets of this transcriptional control. For the transcription factor Gcn4, we demonstrate that this control is mediated through the PKA and Snf1 signaling cascade. The discrepancy between flux response predictions, based on the known regulatory network architecture and our functional (13)C-data, demonstrates the importance of identifying and quantifying the extent to which regulatory effectors alter cellular functions.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry is an important technique for analyzing proteins and other biomolecular compounds in biological samples. Each of the vendors of these mass spectrometers uses a different proprietary binary output file format, which has hindered data sharing and the development of open source software for downstream analysis. The solution has been to develop, with the full participation of academic researchers as well as software and hardware vendors, an open XML-based format for encoding mass spectrometer output files, and then to write software to use this format for archiving, sharing, and processing. This chapter presents the various components and information available for this format, mzML. In addition to the XML schema that defines the file structure, a controlled vocabulary provides clear terms and definitions for the spectral metadata, and a semantic validation rules mapping file allows the mzML semantic validator to insure that an mzML document complies with one of several levels of requirements. Complete documentation and example files insure that the format may be uniformly implemented. At the time of release, there already existed several implementations of the format and vendors have committed to supporting the format in their products.},

@article{Mavrianos2013,
abstract = {Two-component signal transduction pathways are one of the primary means by which microorganisms respond to environmental signals. These signaling cascades originated in prokaryotes and were inherited by eukaryotes via endosymbiotic lateral gene transfer from ancestral cyanobacteria. We report here that the nuclear genome of the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans contains elements of a two-component signaling pathway that seem to be targeted to the mitochondria. The C. albicans two-component response regulator protein Srr1 (stress response regulator 1) contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N terminus, and fluorescence microscopy reveals mitochondrial localization of green fluorescent protein-tagged Srr1. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicates that C. albicans Srr1 is more closely related to histidine kinases and response regulators found in marine bacteria than are other two-component proteins present in the fungi. These data suggest conservation of this protein during the evolutionary transition from endosymbiont to a subcellular organelle. We used microarray analysis to determine whether the phenotypes observed with a srr1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant could be correlated with gene transcriptional changes. The expression of mitochondrial genes was altered in the srr1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ null mutant in comparison to their expression in the wild type. Furthermore, apoptosis increased significantly in the srr1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant strain compared to the level of apoptosis in the wild type, suggesting the activation of a mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic cell death pathway in the srr1$\Delta$/$\Delta$ mutant. Collectively, this study shows for the first time that a lower eukaryote like C. albicans possesses a two-component response regulator protein that has survived in mitochondria and regulates a subset of genes whose functions are associated with the oxidative stress response and programmed cell death (apoptosis).},
